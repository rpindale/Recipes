      "Published: March 15, 2022 Last Modified: March 15, 2022 By Sara 18 Comments \n",
      "This recipe for potato skins is Russet potato halves topped with cheese and bacon, then baked to crispy perfection and finished with sour cream and green onions. A classic appetizer that’s easy to make and always a crowd pleaser!\n",
      "I love to serve a variety of hot appetizers when I’m entertaining, including baked buffalo wings, jalapeno poppers and these loaded potato skins.\n",
      "Baked potato skins are popular for good reason – who can resist the combination of bacon, cheese and sour cream? Not me! These homemade potato snacks are SO much better than anything you’d buy in the freezer section, and they’re easy to make too!\n",
      "For this recipe you will need potatoes, and olive oil, salt and pepper to season the potatoes. Next up are the toppings which include shredded cheese, bacon, sour cream and green onions. Put everything together and you’ll have the ultimate appetizer.\n",
      "First, bake some small Russet potatoes for about an hour, or until softened. Cut the potatoes in half and scoop out the insides making the “skins.” Leave 1/4 to 1/2 inch of potato on the inside of the skins.\n",
      "Brush the skins with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Bake the potato skins until crispy, then add all of your toppings. The potatoes get one more trip through the oven, then they’re ready to garnish and serve.\n",
      "To bake a potato, simply wash and dry the potato, prick it with a fork and place it in the oven at 400 degrees F. The potato needs to stay in the oven for about an hour or until softened. The bake time will vary depending on the size of the potatoes.\n",
      "Leftovers will stay fresh in the refrigerator for 2 days. You can place the skins back in the oven to warm them through and crisp them up. I recommend removing the sour cream and green onions before they go back into the oven, then put fresh toppings on after they’re heated through.\n",
      "The total bake time for this recipe is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which takes into account the time to bake the whole potatoes, as well as crisp up the skins.\n",
      "Classic potato skins are delicious baked potatoes in the palm of your hand, but there are other flavors you can incorporate.\n",
      "These potatoes are amazing and are so much better than restaurant or frozen versions. They are great for a party or just for an every day snack.\n",
