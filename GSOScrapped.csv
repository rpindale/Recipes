dessert,Baklava,"Thaw the phyllo dough. For best results, transfer the package of phyllo dough to the refrigerator overnight. Then let it rest on the counter (still in its packaging) at room temperature for 1 hour before working with it. Make the honey syrup. Meanwhile, combine the honey, water, sugar and orange juice in a small saucepan. Heat over medium-high heat until the mixture nearly reaches a simmer, stirring occasionally.  Reduce heat to medium and continue simmering for 5 minutes. Transfer the syrup to a heat-safe bowl, stir in the orange blossom water (if using), and refrigerate the syrup until ready to use.

Reduce speed to low and gradually add the milk until it is just combined. The batter will be liquid. Bake. Fill the cupcake liners so that they are just over halfway full. Bake for 14 to 16 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let the cupcakes cool completely to room temperature.  To Make The Buttercream:  Beat the butter. Add the butter to a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer and beat on medium speed for 2 to 3 minutes until it is light and fluffy. Add the remaining ingredients. Add the powdered sugar, heavy cream and vanilla extract and beat on low speed for 1 minute until combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, then beat on medium speed for 2 more minutes until completely smooth. Adjust consistency if needed. If the buttercream seems too thin, add in 1 to 2 cups of additional powdered sugar and beat until smooth. If the buttercream seems too thick, add in 1 tablespoon of heavy cream (or more, if needed) and beat until smooth. See notes below for storage directions.","Vanilla Cupcake Ingredients:  1 3/4 cups cake flour (not self-rising flour) 1 cup granulated sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 cup salted butter, room temperature 2 large eggs, room temperature 1/3 cup full-fat sour cream 1/4 cup vegetable oil (or canola oil) 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 2/3 cup whole milk, room temperature optional: sprinkles (see note below)  Vanilla Buttercream Ingredients:  1 cup salted butter, room temperature 4 cups powdered sugar 1/4 cup heavy cream 1 tablespoon vanilla extract"
dessert,Salted Chocolate Peanut Butter Oat Cups,"Prep the oat mixture. Heat the peanut butter and honey in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until warm but not hot. (You can also do this in the microwave if you prefer.) Add the oats to the peanut butter mixture and stir until combined. Press into baking cups. Portion the oat mixture evenly into a silicone* or non-stick 12-cup muffin pan (approximately 1/3 cup of the oat mixture per baking cup). Then use a spoon to press the oat mixture firmly into each baking cup. Add the chocolate. Rinse out the saucepan, then return it to the burner. Add the dark chocolate and coconut oil to the saucepan. Heat over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the chocolate is completely melted and smooth. Remove pan from heat. Spoon approximately 1 tablespoon of chocolate on top of each oat cup, spreading the chocolate so that it covers the top of each baking cup.* Freeze. Transfer the pan to the freezer and chill for at least 1 hour, or until the oat mixture is firm. Serve. Pop out however many oat cups you would like to serve, sprinkle each with a pinch of flaky sea salt, then serve immediately and enjoy! Store any remaining oat cups in the freezer until ready to serve.","3/4 cup natural creamy peanut butter 1/3 cup honey 3 cups old-fashioned oats 5 ounces dark chocolate, roughly chopped 1 tablespoon coconut oil flaky sea salt, for sprinkling"
dessert,Hummingbird Cake,"Prep the oven and cake pans. Heat oven to 350°F. Grease and flour three 8-inch* cake pans, tapping out any excess flour. Mix the cake batter. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, cardamom, and ginger until combined. Add the eggs, oil and vanilla extract, stirring until the ingredients just combined and no dry streaks remain. (Try to avoid over-mixing.) Add the bananas, pineapple and pecans and stir until evenly combined. Bake. Portion the batter evenly between the three cake pans. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean. Transfer the cakes to a wire rack and let them cool completely to room temperature before frosting. Mix the frosting. In a large mixing bowl (or see stand mixer option below), whisk together the cream cheese, butter, vanilla extract and salt until evenly combined. Gradually add in the powdered sugar until incorporated, then whisk the frosting vigorously for 1 to 2 minutes until smooth and fluffy. If the frosting seems too thin, add extra powdered sugar. If it seems too thick, add in a tablespoon or two of water. Assemble the cake. Place one cake layer on a cake stand or serving plate. Spread about 1 cup of frosting evenly on top of the cake, extending over the edges. Repeat with a second layer of cake, followed by an additional 1 cup of frosting. Repeat with the third layer of cake, then spread the remaining frosting evenly over the top and sides of the cake until smooth. Sprinkle extra chopped pecans on the cake as decoration, if desired.

dessert,Basque Cheesecake (Tarta de Queso),"Prep oven and springform pan. Heat oven to 400°F.  Line a 9-inch springform pan with two large crisscrossed sheets of parchment paper, pleating and pressing the parchment into the bottom edges of pan so that it extends straight up (not folded down) a few inches above the sides of the pan.  Place the pan on a large baking sheet and set aside. Make the batter. Add the cream cheese and granulated sugar to a large mixing bowl and use a handheld mixer (or a stand mixer) to beat the mixture on medium speed for 2 minutes, or until it is very smooth with no lumps remaining, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.  Add the eggs one at a time, beating on medium-low speed until each egg is combined before adding in the next. Add the cream, vanilla extract, salt and mix on low speed until evenly combined.  Then sprinkle the flour evenly over the batter (it helps to sift it through a fine-mesh strainer to prevent lumps) and mix on low speed until evenly combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Bake. Pour the mixture into the parchment-lined pan.  Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until the top of the cheesecake has risen up high, the top is a deep golden brown, and the center is still slightly jiggly.  (Keep a close eye on it — if the top starts to get too browned or starts to burn, just gently lay a sheet of aluminum foil on top of the cheesecake until it has finished cooking.) Cool. Transfer the cheesecake to a wire baking rack and let it cool completely to room temperature.  (You can also cover and refrigerate the cheesecake at this point for up to 3 days if you prefer.) Serve. Once the cheesecake is no longer warm, remove the sides of the springform pan, peel back the parchment, and cut your desired size of slices.  Then serve, sprinkled with a pinch of flaky sea salt if you’d like, and enjoy!","2 pounds full-fat cream cheese, room temperature 1 1/3 cups white granulated sugar 5 large eggs, room temperature 1 1/4 cups heavy cream, room temperature 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 teaspoon fine sea salt* (plus optional flaky sea salt for topping) 1/4 cup all-purpose flour"
dessert,Peanut Butter Blossoms,"Freeze Hershey’s kisses. Unwrap the Hershey’s kisses (or mini peanut butter cups), place them on a plate and chill in the freezer until ready to use. Mix the dry ingredients. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt until combined. Mix the wet ingredients. Add the butter, white sugar and brown sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer. (Or alternately, you can use a hand mixer with a large mixing bowl.)  Beat the butter and sugars together on medium-high speed for 2 minutes, until light and fluffy.  Add in the peanut butter, egg, milk and vanilla extract and beat on low speed for 1 minute, until combined, pausing to scrape down the sides of the bowl whenever needed.  Add in the flour mixture and meet on low speed for 1 minute, until combined. Chill the dough. Transfer the dough to a sealed food storage container and chill for about 1 hour.  (Or see a speedier chilling method in the notes below.) Prep the oven and baking sheet. Heat the oven to 375°F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Prep the dough balls. Form the dough into a 1-tablespoon dough balls ball (I find it’s easiest to do this with a small cookie scoop), gently roll the balls in granulated white sugar until evenly coated, and place on the prepared baking sheet at least 2 inches apart. Bake. Bake for 10 minutes, or until the cookies begin to slightly crack on top. Add the kisses. Transfer the baking sheet to a wire cooling rack.  Then immediately take the frozen Hershey’s kisses and press them gently into the middle of the cookies.  Let the cookies cool to room temperature…then enjoy!","36 Hershey’s Kisses (or mini peanut butter cups) 1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking soda 3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, room temperature 1/3 cup granulated (white) sugar, plus extra for rolling 1/3 cup packed light brown sugar 3/4 cup creamy peanut butter* 1 large egg 2 tablespoons milk 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract"
dessert,Linzer Cookies,"Combine the dry ingredients. Combine the all-purpose flour, almond flour, salt, and cinnamon (if using) in a medium mixing bowl, and stir until evenly combined. Combine the wet ingredients. Add the butter and sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer (or you can use a hand mixer with a large mixing bowl) and beat on medium-high speed for 2 minutes until the mixture is light and fluffy.  Add the vanilla extract, almond extract (if using), egg and zest to the butter mixture and beat on low speed for 30 seconds until combined. Add in the dry ingredients. Add the dry ingredient mixture and beat on low speed for 1 minute or so until combined, pausing to scrape down the sides of the bowl at any point if needed. Chill the dough. Shape the dough into a disk about 1-inch thick, wrap tightly with beeswrap or plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30-60 minutes or until chilled. Prep the oven and baking sheet. Heat the oven to 350°F and line a large baking sheet with parchment. Roll out the dough. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and using a rolling pin to roll it out until it is about 1/4-inch thick.  Cut out your desired shapes with your cookie cutters (half solid shapes, half with cut-out “windows”) and place them on the prepared baking sheet.  Re-roll out any dough scraps that remain and repeat the process to make use of all of the dough.  At this point, if the cut-out cookie dough seems soft and warm, it’s best to pop the entire cookie sheet in the fridge for 10 minutes to re-chill the dough.  Otherwise, proceed immediately with the next step. Bake. Bake the cookies for about 11-13 minutes, or until the cookies are lightly golden around the edges.  Different sizes/shapes of cookies may require different amounts of cooking time, so I recommend keeping a close eye on the cookies during the final minutes or baking to be sure that they do not overcook. Cool. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the cookies rest for a few minutes.  Then transfer the cookies to a wire rack until they have cooled completely to room temperature. Assemble the cookies. Transfer the cut-out window cookies back to the baking sheet and use a fine mesh strainer to dust them with powdered sugar.  Then spread a dollop of jam on a solid cookie and gently place a window cookie on top to form a cute little Linzer cookie sandwich.  Repeat with remaining cookies and enjoy!","2 cups all-purpose flour 1 cup almond flour 3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional) 1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature 2/3 cup granulated white sugar 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon almond extract (optional) 1 large egg zest of 1 lemon or orange powdered sugar, for dusting any flavor of jam, for filling"

dessert,Easy Apple Pandowdy,"Thaw the puff pastry. Remove puff pastry from the freezer* and let it sit out while you prepare the rest of the ingredients so that it can thaw for about 20 to 30 minutes. Heat the oven. Heat the oven to 425°F. Prepare the apples. Core and peel the apples (if desired), cut them into 1/2-inch thick slices, and add the apples to a large mixing bowl. Add the lemon juice and zest to the apples and gently toss to combine. Combine the filling. Add the brown sugar, 2 tablespoons of the melted butter, flour, cinnamon, vanilla extract, cardamom, ginger, sea salt and cloves to the apples.  Gently toss the mixture until combined and the apples are evenly coated.  Spread the mixture out in an even layer in a 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Prepare the puff pastry topping. Gently unfold the puff pastry and transfer it to a lightly-floured cutting board.  Use a pizza slicer or a knife to roughly cut the pastry into 1-inch squares (or whatever size/shape you desire).  Layer the squares over the apples so that they are lightly overlapping, taking care to press down any corners that are sticking up noticeably (so that the corners do not burn).  Use a pastry brush to brush the puff pastry with the remaining 2 tablespoons of melted butter. Bake. Bake uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes, until the puff pastry is lightly golden on top.  (Keep an eye on it though, and if it starts to look too dark, you can gently lay a sheet of aluminum foil on top of the puff pastry to prevent it from toasting further.)  Lower the oven heat to 350°F and bake for 30 more minutes, until the filling is bubbly and the apples are soft. Transfer the baking dish to a wire cooling rack. Press down the topping. Use a spoon to gently press the puff pastry topping down a bit into the bubbly filling.  (You don’t want to completely submerge all of the puff pastry, but rather just give it a chance to briefly soak up more of those yummy juices).  Use a fine mesh strainer to dust the puff pastry with a layer of powdered sugar. Serve warm. Serve warm, topped with a scoop of cold vanilla ice cream, and enjoy!","1 (14-ounce) package frozen puff pastry 4 pounds Granny Smith apples (about 8 apples) juice and zest from 1 lemon 1/2 cup packed brown sugar 1/4 cup melted butter,* divided 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 teaspoon ground cardamom* 1 teaspoon ground ginger 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt 1/4 teaspoon each: ground cloves and ground nutmeg* powdered sugar"

appetizers,Jalapeño Salsa,"Boil the jalapeños and garlic. Place the jalapeños and 11 cloves of the garlic (we will save one for later) in a large saucepan. Add water to the pan so that the jalapeños are completely covered. Bring to a high simmer over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium to maintain the simmer for about 15-20 minutes, until the jalapeños and garlic cloves have completely softened. Core the jalapeños and peel the garlic. Reserve 1 cup of the jalapeño cooking water, then drain off the rest. Carefully use tongs to transfer the jalapeños to a cutting board. Then slice each jalapeño in half lengthwise and use a spoon to scoop out and discard the veins and seeds. (Or if you would like a spicier salsa, you can skip this step.) Gently squeeze the cooked garlic cloves out of their peels, and peel the remaining one raw garlic clove. Blend. Add the cored jalapeños, cooked garlic cloves, raw garlic clove, oil, lime juice (if using), 1 teaspoon sea salt, and 1/4 cup of the reserved jalapeño cooking water* to a high-speed blender.

appetizers,Homemade Tortilla Chips,"Heat the oil. Pour enough oil in a sauté pan so that it is between 1/4 to 1/2-inches deep.  Heat the oil over medium-high heat until its temperature reaches 350°F.  Then reduce the heat to medium, adjusting the heat as needed (you will need to check it fairly often) to try and maintain that temperature as best as possible. Fry the tortillas. Carefully add about a dozen tortilla triangles (or however many form a single layer without overlapping) to the oil.  Fry for 2 to 3 minutes, occasionally using a spider strainer to stir and dunk the tortillas below the surface of the oil, until they are lightly golden and crispy.  Cooking time will vary depending on the thickness of your tortillas. Drain. Use the spider strainer to quickly and carefully transfer the tortilla chips to a paper-towel-lined baking sheet and spread them out in an even-ish layer, so that the chips can drain and cool.  Sprinkle evenly with a pinch of flaky sea salt, or any other desired seasonings, to taste. Repeat. Repeat the process with the remaining tortilla triangles until all have been fried.  (While each batch is frying, I carefully push the finished chips to one side of the baking sheet to make room for the next batch to drain.)

Place the eggplants flesh-side-down on the baking sheet along with the unpeeled garlic cloves.  Roast everything together for 20 minutes*, then remove the garlic cloves and set them aside to cool.  Return the sheet of eggplants to the oven and continue roasting for 25-35 more minutes, until the eggplants have collapsed and the flesh is completely soft and tender. (Cooking time will depend on the size of your eggplants and garlic cloves.) Transfer the baking sheet to a wire cooling rack and let the eggplants rest flesh-side-down, undisturbed, for about 20 minutes so that the eggplant flesh can continue to steam inside of its skins. Strain the eggplant. Once the eggplant has cooled a bit, use a spoon to scoop out the soft flesh and transfer it to a large fine-mesh strainer. Use the spoon to gently press and strain out the excess water over the sink, then transfer the flesh to a large mixing bowl. Combine the ingredients. Peel the roasted garlic and add it to the mixing bowl.  Use a fork to stir and gently mash the eggplant and roasted garlic until they reach a smooth-yet-slightly-chunky consistency. Add in the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, tahini, lemon juice, salt, cumin, and a tablespoon or two of chopped fresh parsley, and stir until combined. Season. Taste and season with extra salt, if needed. Serve. Serve immediately, topped with an extra drizzle of olive oil and sprinkled with some extra parsley and a pinch of sumac. Leftovers can be refrigerated in a sealed container for up to 3-4 days.","2 to 2.5 pounds Italian eggplants (about 3 small eggplants) 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided (plus extra for drizzling) 4 large cloves garlic, unpeeled 1/3 cup tahini 3 tablespoons lemon juice 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin 2 to 4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley optional: ground sumac, for sprinkling"
breakfast,Pumpkin Coffee Cake,"Make the streusel topping. Add the flour, brown sugar, chopped nuts, pumpkin pie spice and salt to a small mixing bowl and whisk until evenly combined. Drizzle the melted butter evenly over the mixture, then toss it with your fingers until it is evenly combined and no dry, sandy parts remain.

Prep the oven and pan. Heat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease a 9-inch springform pan.* Combine the dry cake ingredients. Add the flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, baking soda and sea salt to a separate mixing bowl and whisk until evenly combined. Make the batter. Add the butter and sugars to the bowl of a stand mixer. (Or alternately, you can use a hand mixer with a large mixing bowl.)  Beat the butter and sugars together on medium-high speed for 2 minutes, until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, pumpkin purée, sour cream, vanilla extract and beat on low speed for 1 to 2 minutes until evenly combined, pausing to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add the dry ingredient mixture and beat on low speed for 1 to 2 minutes, until just combined. Bake. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread it out in an even layer. Sprinkle the streusel topping evenly on top. Then bake the cake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle of the cake comes out clean. Transfer the cake to a wire rack and let it cool to room temperature. Prepare the cream cheese drizzle. Meanwhile, as the cake is baking, whisk together all of the cream cheese drizzle ingredients until completely smooth. If the drizzle seems too thick, add extra milk. If it seems too thin, add extra powdered sugar. Drizzle. Once the cake has cooled completely to room temperature (if you can wait that long), drizzle it with the cream cheese icing.

breakfast,Easy Granola Clusters,"Prep the oven and baking sheet. Heat oven to 300°F (150°C). Line a half sheet pan (18 x 13 inches) with parchment paper and set aside. Heat the wet ingredients. Combine the maple syrup, coconut oil, sea salt, cinnamon and vanilla extract in a small saucepan. Heat the mixture for 4-5 minutes over medium heat until warm (the coconut oil should be completely melted) but not simmering, whisking until evenly combined. Remove from heat. Add the dry ingredients. In a large mixing bowl, add the oats, almonds, coconut flakes, pecans and sunflower seeds. Drizzle the maple syrup mixture over the dry ingredients. Gently toss until evenly combined. Bake. Spread the granola out evenly on the sheet pan and then gently press it down with a spatula.

breakfast,Butternut Squash Quiche,"Partially blind-bake the pie crust. Press the pie crust evenly into a 9-inch pie pan.  Transfer the pie crust to the freezer to chill for 15-20 minutes, while your oven heats to 400°F (205°C).  Once the crust is chilled and firm, carefully line it with parchment paper.  Then fill the crust with pie weights (or dried beans) and bake for 10-12 minutes, until the edges of the crust are lightly golden.  Transfer the pie pan to a wire baking rack and carefully remove the parchment paper with the pie weights. Sauté the veggies. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large non-stick sauté pan over medium-high heat.  Add the butternut squash and sauté for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until mostly cooked through.  Add the white parts of the chopped scallions and garlic.  Sauté for 2 more minutes, stirring constantly, until the garlic is fragrant and the veggies are softened.  Stir in the green parts of the scallions, kale and rosemary until combined, then remove the sauté pan from the heat. Layer the quiche. Arrange the veggie mixture in an even layer in the pre-baked pie crust and sprinkle the crumbled goat cheese evenly on top.  In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, half and half, salt and pepper until combined, then pour the mixture evenly over the veggies and cheese.  Give the quiche filling a brief gentle stir so that some of the veggies and cheese float to the top. Bake. Then bake the quiche for 45 minutes, or until the top is golden and puffy, and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool and serve. Transfer the quiche back to the wire rack and let it rest for at least 10 minutes.  Then slice, serve and enjoy!","1 unbaked 9-inch pie crust 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 cups diced butternut squash (diced into 1/2-inch cubes) 2 scallions, chopped with the white and green parts separated 3 cloves garlic, pressed or minced 1 handful chopped fresh kale (tough stems removed) 1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary 5 ounces crumbled goat cheese 6 large eggs 1 cup half and half* 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt a few twists of freshly-cracked black pepper"

breakfast,Pumpkin Cinnamon Rolls,"Heat the milk and butter. Combine milk and butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat on high for 1 minute, then remove and stir to help melt and dissolve the butter. Continue heating in 20 second intervals, pausing after each to stir, until the butter is melted and the milk is warm but not hot to the touch.  (I recommend measuring the temperature with a cooking thermometer. It should be around 110°F.)  If the mixture is too hot, it can kill the yeast, so just wait a few minutes until it reaches the correct temperature. Combine dry ingredients.  In a separate bowl, whisk together 3 cups of the flour (not all of the flour), granulated sugar, pumpkin pie spice, and salt until combined. Mix the dough. In the bowl of a stand mixer* fitted with the dough-hook attachment, add the warm milk mixture and sprinkle the yeast on top, then give the mixture a brief stir.  Add the flour mixture, pumpkin purée and egg, and beat on medium-low speed until combined. If the dough is sticking to the sides of the bowl, add the remaining flour, 1/4 cup at a time, until the dough begins to form a ball and pulls away from the sides of the bowl.  (The dough will still be moist and slightly sticky though.)  Continue beating for 5 minutes on medium-low speed. Remove dough and form it into a ball with your hands.  Place the dough ball in a greased bowl, cover with a damp towel, and let it rest for 10 minutes. Mix the cinnamon-sugar filling.  While the dough rests, make your filling by whisking together the granulated sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice together in a small mixing bowl until combined. Roll out the dough.  Once the dough is ready, turn it out onto a floured work surface. Use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about 10 x 15 inches in size. (If you want all of the edges to be even, you can use a pizza slicer to cut the dough into an even rectangle.) Use a knife or an offset spatula to spread 1/4 cup of softened butter (for the cinnamon filling) out evenly over the entire surface of the dough. Sprinkle the dough evenly with the cinnamon and sugar mixture, and gently pat it down into the butter. Roll up the dough. Beginning at the 15-inch edge, tightly roll up the dough and give the final seam a little pinch so that it seals. Use a piece of dental floss* or a knife to slice off the two ends of the roll (just 1/2-inch or so on each end, since the ends typically don’t have as much cinnamon and sugar filling, which you can discard) so that the ends are even. Cut the remaining dough into 12 equal rounds. Let the dough rise. Place each of the cut cinnamon rolls into a greased 9 x 13-inch baking dish.  Cover the dish with a damp towel, and leave it in a warm place to rise for 25 minutes.  Heat the oven to 350°F. Make the frosting.  While the dough is rising, whisk the maple cream cheese frosting ingredients together in a mixing bowl until smooth.  If the frosting seems too thick, add in an extra tablespoon of milk at a time until it reaches your desired consistency.  If it is too thin, add in extra powdered sugar. Bake. Once the rolls have risen, uncover the dish and place it on the center rack of the oven. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the rolls are golden and cooked through. Transfer the baking dish to a wire rack and let the rolls cool for at least 5 minutes. Frost. Drizzle or spread with the maple cream cheese frosting, serve warm and enjoy!","Pumpkin Cinnamon Rolls:  1/2 cup milk 1/4 cup butter 1 envelope (2 1/4 teaspoons) instant (“rapid rise”) yeast 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt 3/4 cup pumpkin purée 1 egg  Cinnamon Filling:  1/4 cup butter, softened 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup packed brown sugar 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon 1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice  Maple Cream Cheese Frosting:  4 ounces (1/2 cup) cream cheese, softened 3 tablespoons butter, softened 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 cup powdered sugar 1/4 cup maple syrup"
breakfast,Pumpkin Scones,"Combine dry ingredients. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice and salt until evenly combined. Cut in the butter. Add the diced butter and use a pastry cutter or two forks (or a food processor, see below) to cut the butter evenly into the dry ingredients until the mixture is crumbly and the butter forms no larger than pea-sized chunks. Add in the wet ingredients. Add in the pumpkin purée, milk and vanilla extract.  Then use a spatula to quickly and gently stir the mixture until no dry streaks remain.  (Try to avoid over-mixing.) Shape the scones. Turn the mixture out onto a flour-dusted surface and fold the dough over on itself a few times until it holds together and can form a ball.  (The dough will be a bit sticky, so don’t worry.)  Pat the dough down flat into an 8-inch circle.  Then use a large knife or bench scraper to slice the dough into 8 equal-sized pie wedges.  (You may need to wipe off your knife between slices if the dough is sticky.) Chill. Transfer the wedges to a parchment-covered baking sheet, spacing them at least 2 inches apart.  Then transfer the baking sheet to the freezer for 15 minutes or so while your oven heats.  Heat the oven to 425°F. Bake. Briefly brush the top of each scone with a bit of buttermilk.  Then transfer the baking sheet to the oven and bake for 13-15 minutes or until the scones are lightly golden on top and cooked through.  Transfer to a wire baking rack to cool.

pastas,Lemongrass Coconut Noodles with Shrimp,"Prepare the lemongrass coconut sauce. Peel and discard the outer layer of the lemongrass stalks, slice off and discard the ends, then roughly chop the remaining stalks into 1/2-inch pieces. Combine the lemongrass, coconut milk, sliced ginger, lime juice and brown sugar in a medium saucepan. Heat over medium heat until the sauce almost reaches a simmer. Reduce heat to low, cover, and continue cooking the sauce (avoid letting it reach a full simmer) for at least 15 minutes, or until the noodle stir-fry is ready. Use a fine-mesh strainer to remove and discard the ginger and lemongrass solids from the sauce just before serving. Stir in the lime juice and fish sauce until combined, and season with salt and pepper as needed. Cook the noodles. Meanwhile, as the sauce is cooking, cook the noodles just barely al dente according to package instructions. Drain the noodles in a strainer and rinse with cold water until the noodles are room temperature. Toss the noodles briefly with a drizzle of oil (I like to use toasted sesame oil, but olive oil will work) to keep them from sticking, and set aside until ready to use. Season the shrimp. Season the shrimp on both sides with a generous sprinkle of salt and freshly-cracked black pepper, and set aside until ready to use. Sauté the veggies. In a large non-stick sauté pan, heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and sauté for 4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the carrots and sauté for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic and sauté for 1 minute, stirring frequently. Add the shrimp. Push the veggies to one side of the pan and add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the empty space. Add the shrimp to the oil and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes, flipping occasionally, until cooked through (they should be pink and opaque). Combine everything. Immediately pour the sauce into the sauté pan with the shrimp and veggies, add in the Thai basil leaves and cooked noodles, and toss everything together until evenly combined. Taste and season with salt and pepper, as needed. Serve. Serve warm, garnished with lots of thinly-sliced green onions, lime wedges, chopped fresh cilantro, extra Thai basil, and/or sliced Thai bird chiles.

pastas,Creamy Tuna Mushroom Pasta,"Cook pasta al dente. Cook pasta in a large stockpot of generously-salted water until it is just 1 minute shy of al dente. (For ideal timing, I recommend adding the pasta to the boiling water after the mushrooms have been sautéing for 3 minutes, as indicated below.) Reserve 1 cup of the starchy pasta water for later, then drain the pasta. Sauté the mushrooms. Meanwhile as the pasta water heats, melt the butter in a large non-stick sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and sauté for 6 to 8 minutes, stirring every 2 minutes or so, until browned. Add the garlic, rosemary and crushed red pepper flakes. Sauté for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.

Cook the noodles. Cook the noodles just shy of al dente, according to package instructions. Drain the noodles and set aside until ready to use. (If the noodles are ready considerably earlier than your veggies, I recommend briefly tossing the noodles with a drizzle of oil to prevent them from sticking to one another.) Stir-fry the chicken (or other protein). Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large sauté pan or wok over medium-high heat. Add the sliced chicken and sauté for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until browned and cooked through. Transfer the chicken to a clean plate and set aside.

pastas,Baked Feta Pasta,"Prep oven. Heat oven to 400°F (205°C). Prep the tomato feta sauce. Place the block of feta in the center of a 9 x 13-inch baking dish.  Arrange the tomatoes around the feta, then drizzle everything evenly with the olive oil and white wine.  (I recommend giving the ingredients a brief toss so that they are evenly coated in the oil.)  Sprinkle the crushed red pepper flakes evenly over the feta, and season the tomatoes with a pinch of salt and black pepper. Bake. Transfer the baking dish to the oven and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until the tomatoes have burst and are nice and juicy. Meanwhile, cook the pasta. While the tomatoes and feta are baking, heat a large stockpot of generously-salted water until boiling.  About 10 minutes or so before the tomatoes and feta are set to finish, add the pasta to the boiling water and cook until it is just 1 minute or so shy of al dente.  Reserve 1 cup of the starchy pasta water and set it aside for later, then drain the pasta.

pastas,Bolognese Sauce,"Cook the pancetta (or bacon). Add the pancetta to a large stockpot and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until lightly crispy.  There should be about 1 to 2 tablespoons of grease that has rendered in the stockpot, but if not, add in a drizzle of olive oil to supplement. Sauté the veggies. Add the onion, carrot and celery to the stockpot and stir to combine.  Sauté for about 7 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the veggies are softened.  Add the garlic, anchovy filets and crushed red pepper flakes and stir to combine.  Sauté for 2 more minutes, stirring occasionally, until fragrant. Brown the meat. Add the ground beef and Italian sausage and toss to combine with the veggies.  Cook until the meat is completely browned, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon as it cooks and flipping it only occasionally so that it can get a bit browned and crispy on the bottom. Deglaze the pan. Add the wine and use the wooden spoon to thoroughly scrape up any browned bits that are stuck to the bottom or sides of the pan. Simmer. Add the San Marzano tomatoes, tomato paste, thyme, bay leaf and stir to thoroughly combine.  Continue cooking until the sauce just barely reaches a simmer.  Then reduce heat to low, cover the stockpot with a lid, and simmer anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours.  (I recommend at least a 2-hour simmer for optimum flavor.)  Be sure to check on the sauce and give it a stir every 30 minutes or so to be sure that the bottom does not burn. Season. Remove and discard the thyme/rosemary sprigs and bay leaf.  Add the milk and stir until combined.  Give the sauce a taste and season with however much additional salt and pepper you believe it needs.  (I typically add in at least a few teaspoons of salt and some generous cracks of black pepper.)  If the sauce seems too thick, you can add in a bit of water (starchy pasta* water works best) to thin it out. Serve. Serve warm with pasta, gnocchi, roasted eggplant, or whatever sounds good (see notes below) and garnish with lots and lots of freshly-grated Parmesan cheese.  Enjoy!","4 ounces diced pancetta (or diced bacon) 1 medium white or yellow onion, finely diced 1 large carrot, finely diced 1 large rib celery, finely diced 3 cloves garlic, minced 2 anchovy filets, roughly chopped* 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1 pound ground beef 1 pound ground mild Italian sausage* 1 cup dry red or white wine 1 (28-ounce) can San Marzano whole tomatoes, hand-crushed* 1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste a few sprigs of fresh thyme and/or rosemary 1 large bay leaf 1 cup whole milk* fine sea salt and freshly-ground black pepper freshly-grated Parmesan cheese, for serving"

pastas,Beef Stroganoff,"Cook the noodles: Cook egg noodles in a large stockpot of generously-salted water until they are al dente, according to package instructions, then drain. (For optimal timing, I recommend adding the egg noodles to the boiling water at the same time that you begin Step 4, listed below.) Sauté the steak: Meanwhile, as your pasta water is coming to a boil, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the steak in a single layer, seasoned with a few generous pinches of salt and pepper, and let it cook undisturbed for about 3 minutes to get a good sear. Flip the steak, and cook on the other side until browned, another 2-3 minutes. Then remove steak from pan with a slotted spoon, transfer to a clean plate, and set aside.  (If your pan is not big enough to fit all of the steak in a single layer, cook half of the steak in 1 tablespoon of butter.

baked-goods,Quick Puff Pastry Cinnamon Rolls,"Prep the oven and baking dish. Heat oven to 400°F. Line a 9×13-inch baking dish with parchment paper and set aside. Prep the cinnamon-sugar mixture. In a small bowl, combine the granulated white sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Whisk until evenly combined and set aside. Roll out the puff pastry. Lightly dust your work surface* with flour and unroll one sheet of puff pastry out so that it is in a single layer. Brush the sheet evenly with half of the melted butter. Sprinkle evenly with half of the cinnamon-sugar mixture, leaving an empty 1-cm border on the right side of the puff pastry. Roll and cut the puff pastry. Beginning on the left side, gently roll the puff pastry vertically to the right side. Gently press the border to seal the roll. Using either a bread knife or piece of dental floss*, slice off about 1/2 inch from each end (since the ends are usually fairly uneven). Then cut the roll into 8 evenly-sized rolls and place them in the parchment-lined baking dish. Repeat. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 with the second sheet of puff pastry and the remaining butter and cinnamon-sugar mixture.

baked-goods,Cheesy Pesto Rolls,"Heat the milk mixture. Combine milk, butter and honey in small saucepan. Heat over medium heat stirring frequently until the butter is melted and the mixture is 110°F. (It should feel warm but not hot to the touch — I recommend measuring the temperature with a cooking thermometer.) If the mixture is too hot, just wait a few minutes for it to cool. Mix the dough. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough-hook attachment (or see notes below for how to knead the dough by hand), add the warm milk mixture. Sprinkle the yeast on top, then give the mixture a brief stir. Add 3 1/2 cups of flour, eggs and salt, and beat on medium-low speed until combined. If the dough is sticking to the sides of the bowl, add more flour (up to an additional 1/2 cup), until the dough begins to form a ball and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. (Use no more than 4 cups of flour total.)  Continue beating for 5 minutes on low speed. Remove dough and form it into a ball with your hands. Place it in a greased bowl and cover with a damp towel. Let rest for 10 minutes. Roll the dough (1st stage).  Once the dough is ready, turn it out onto a floured work surface. Use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about 12 x 18 inches in size. Spread the pesto evenly over the top of the dough, leaving a 1-inch border on the left side (as shown in the photos above). Sprinkle the mozzarella and Parmesan evenly over the pesto, followed by a few extra twists of freshly-cracked black pepper and a pinch of sea salt. Roll out the dough (2nd stage). Beginning at the 18-inch edge, tightly roll up the dough and give the final seam a little pinch so that it seals. Use a piece of dental floss or a knife to slice off the top and bottom ends of the roll (just 1/2-inch or so on each end, which you can discard) so that the ends are even. Cut the remaining dough into 12 equal rounds. Let the dough rise. Place the rolls into a lightly-greased 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Cover the dish with a damp towel, and leave it in a warm place to rise for 25 minutes. Heat the oven to 350°F. Bake.

Prep the baking cups. Portion the batter evenly into prepared baking cups.  Then sprinkle a generous pinch of turbinado sugar on top of each cup of muffin batter, if you would like. Bake. Bake for 15-18 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the muffins comes out clean.  Remove from the oven and place the pan on a wire cooling rack until the muffins cool to room temperature. Make the cream cheese drizzle. While the muffins bake, whisk together the cream cheese drizzle ingredients in a small mixing bowl until smooth.

baked-goods,Cornbread,"Prep the oven and skillet. Heat oven to 400°F.  Add the butter to a 9-inch or 10-inch cast iron skillet, then transfer the skillet to the oven. Brown the butter.  While you prepare steps 3 and 4 (below), let the butter melt and simmer in the oven until it is lightly browned and smells toasty, keeping a very close eye on it so that the butter does not accidentally burn.  Use an oven mitt to remove the pan from the oven, then carefully swirl the melted butter to coat the edges of the skillet, and pour the browned butter into a separate bowl until ready to use.  (Or if you’ve already reached step 5, you can go ahead and just pour the browned butter directly into the batter after the buttermilk mixture.) Combine the dry ingredients. Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda and fine sea salt until combined. Combine the wet ingredients. In a separate small mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs and honey until evenly combined.  Add the buttermilk and whisk until combined. Finish the batter. Create a well in the center of the dry ingredient bowl, and pour the buttermilk mixture into the well.  Gently whisk the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined.  Pour the melted butter into the batter and stir until it is just combined, taking care not to over-mix the batter. Bake. Pour the batter evenly into the cast iron skillet.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cornbread comes out clean. Cool. Carefully transfer the skillet to a wire cooling rack and let the cornbread cool for at least 10 minutes.  Then slice, serve, and enjoy!","1/2 cup unsalted butter 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 cup yellow cornmeal 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon fine sea salt* 2 eggs 1/3 cup honey 1 cup buttermilk, room temperature"
baked-goods,Homemade Naan,"Activate the yeast: Briefly stir together the warm water and honey in the bowl of a stand mixer.  (Or see notes below about how to make the dough by hand.)  Sprinkle the yeast on top of the water and give it a quick stir, then let the mixture rest for 5-10 minutes until the yeast is foamy. Mix the dough: Add the flour, yogurt, salt, baking powder, and egg.  Using the dough attachment, mix the dough on medium-low speed for 2-3 minutes until smooth.  (The dough will still be slightly sticky, but should form into a ball that pulls away from the sides of the mixing bowl.  If it’s too sticky, add a bit more flour.) Let the dough rise. Remove dough from the mixing bowl and use your hands to shape it into a ball.  Grease the mixing bowl (or a separate bowl) lightly with cooking spray, then place the dough ball back in the bowl and cover it with a damp towel.  Place the bowl in a warm location (I set mine by a sunny window) and let it rise for 1 hour until the dough has nearly doubled in size. (Optional) Make the garlic butter: During the last 10 minutes of the dough’s rise time, heat the butter in a small sauté pan over medium heat until melted.  Add the garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.  Remove the pan from heat and stir in some chopped herbs, if desired.  (You can also strain out the garlic chunks if you prefer the garlic butter to be completely smooth.) Roll out the dough. Once the dough is ready to go, transfer it to a floured work surface and shape it into an even(ish) circle.  Cut the dough into 8 equally-sized wedges and roll each wedge into a ball with your hands.  Then use a rolling pin to roll out the dough ball until it forms an oval about 1/4-inch thick.  (I recommend multi-tasking this process — rolling out the next dough ball while you cook one on the stove.) Cook the dough. Heat a large cast-iron skillet or non-stick sauté pan over medium-high heat until it is nice and hot.  Add a piece of the rolled-out dough to the pan and cook for 1 minute, or until the top of the dough begins to bubble and the bottom turns lightly golden.  Flip the dough and cook on the second side for 30-60 seconds, or until the bottom is golden as well, then transfer the dough to a clean plate.  (If you are making garlic naan, brush one or both side(s) of the dough with the garlic butter once the naan has cooked.)  Sprinkle the naan with a pinch of flaky sea salt, if desired. Then lightly cover the naan with a clean towel so that it stays warm.  Repeat with remaining dough until all of the naan pieces are cooked, adjusting the heat of the pan if needed to keep it hot (but not overly-hot so that it burns the bread). Serve. Serve warm and enjoy!","Naan Ingredients:  1 cup warm water (about 110°F) 2 tablespoons honey 1 (0.25 ounce) package active dry yeast (about 2 1/4 teaspoons) 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/4 cup plain yogurt 2 teaspoons fine sea salt 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1 large egg  (Optional) Garlic Butter Ingredients:  1/4 cup salted butter 3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced finely- chopped fresh cilantro or parsley (optional) flaky sea salt"

Cut in the butter. Sprinkle the diced butter over the dry ingredient mixture. Use a pastry cutter or two forks (or a food processor*) to cut the butter into the dry ingredients until it is well-mixed and forms pea-sized chunks of butter. Add the buttermilk. Pour in the cold buttermilk and stir until the dough until it is just combined.  (Try to avoid over-mixing the dough.) Form the dough. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface. Use your hands to quickly shape the dough into a small rectangle.  Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out evenly until it is about 1/2-inch thick. Fold the dough. Then fold the dough on top of itself into thirds (like you are folding an envelope, see image above). Rotate the dough 90 degrees.  Then repeat the folding process a second time, rotate, repeat the folding process a third time, rotate. Cut the dough. Roll the dough out once more into a roughly 10 x 5-inch rectangle.  Then use a 2 to 2.5-inch biscuit cutter to firmly cut the dough into 8 circles, taking care not to twist the biscuit cutter at all when cutting the dough, and arrange the biscuits evenly on the prepared baking sheet.*  If you would like, re-roll the remaining dough scraps and cut out 1 or 2 more biscuits. Heat the oven. Heat the oven to 450°F (232°C).  And transfer the biscuits to your freezer or refrigerator for 15 minutes as the oven heats. Bake. Once the oven is ready to go, bake the biscuits for 10-12 minutes, or until they achieve your desired level of browning on top.  Transfer the baking sheet to a wire rack.  Then, if you would like, brush the tops of the biscuits with some melted butter and sprinkle with a pinch of flaky sea salt.

snacks,Next-Level Rice Krispie Treats,"Prep the broiler and marshmallows. Set the broiler to high heat and place the oven rack about 6 inches below the heating elements.  Arrange the marshmallows on a sheet pan in a single even layer, so that no marshmallows are overlapping.  Set aside until ready to use. Brown the butter. Heat the butter in a large stockpot over medium high heat until it has melted and begins to foam, stirring frequently to ensure that the butter cooks evenly.  Keep a close eye on the butter as it continues to cook, stirring frequently, until the butter starts to turn golden brown and smells toasty.  Once the butter reaches this stage, immediately remove the pan from the heat and pour the butter into a heatproof dish momentarily, so that the cooking process will be halted.  Set aside while you toast the marshmallows. “Toast” the marshmallows. Once the butter is ready to go, place the pan of marshmallows in the oven and broil for 30 to 60 seconds, until the marshmallows are puffy and deeply golden on top.  (They cook quickly, so keep a very close eye on them!)  Remove the pan from the oven. Stir everything together. Moving quickly throughout this step, pour the browned butter back into the stockpot, along with the bourbon and salt, and briefly stir to combine.  Immediately transfer the toasted marshmallows to the stockpot (I find it’s easiest to do this with a large spatula) and briefly stir to combine.  Add in the Rice Krispies and stir until they are more or less evenly coated.  It’s ok if there are some marshmallow clumps in there. Press into the baking dish. Transfer the mixture to a parchment-lined (or greased) 9 x 9-inch baking dish, and gently press the mixture down into an even layer.  Let the rice crispy treats cool until they reach room temperature.

Fry bacon in a large saute pan over medium-high heat until cooked.  Transfer bacon to a separate plate with a slotted spoon, and set aside. Meanwhile, keep about 1 tablespoon of the remaining bacon grease in the saute pan (you can discard the extra if there’s too much grease in there).  Stir in the Brussels sprouts, red onion, and sliced garlic.  Saute for 4-5 minutes, stirring frequently, until the mixture is softened and the garlic is fragrant.  Remove from the heat and set aside. Place the two pieces of flatbread on a large baking sheet, and brush the tops of each with olive oil.  Sprinkle each piece of flatbread evenly with about 1/3 cup Mozzarella cheese, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges of the flatbread.  Then divide the Brussels mixture, bacon and crumbled cheese evenly between the two pieces of flatbread, and spread them out evenly.  Sprinkle with the remaining Mozzarella cheese.

pizzas,Pizza Spaghetti Squash Boats,"Preheat oven to 400°F.  Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, then mist with cooking spray.  Set aside. Using a sharp knife, very carefully cut the spaghetti squash in half lengthwise.  (I find it helps to microwave the squash for 2-3 minutes before cutting to soften it up.)  Use a spoon to scoop out and discard the seeds and stringy pulp in the center of the squash.  Then brush the flesh of the squash evenly with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and place the squash halves cut-side-down on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the inside of the squash is cooked through and shreds easily with a fork.  (Larger squash halves will take longer to bake.)  Remove from oven, and let the squash cool for a few minutes. Using a fork, shred the inside of the squash until all of the flesh is spaghetti-like.  Then add 1/2 cup (more or less) pizza sauce and 1/4 cup shredded cheese to each squash half, and gently give it a toss until all of the spaghetti-ed squash is evenly coated with the sauce. Sprinkle a few pizza evenly toppings on top of the sauce on each squash half, followed by about 1/4 cup mozzarella cheese, followed by a few more pizza toppings as desired. Turn the oven to broil.  Place the baking sheet with the spaghetti squash pizzas in the oven (I placed mine on a rack 1/3 from the top of the oven) and broil for 4-6 minutes — keeping a close eye on the pizzas so that they do not burn — until the cheese is melted and starts to turn a little bit golden.

When the quinoa has finished cooking, fluff the quinoa with a fork.  Then stir about 1/2 cup pizza sauce into the quinoa until evenly combined.  Set aside. Lightly spray 6 large (10-ounce) oven-safe ramekins with cooking spray.  Place the ramekins on a large baking tray. Spread about 2 Tablespoons of pizza sauce evenly over the bottom of each ramekin. Layer each with about 1/4 cup of quinoa, and spread with a spoon to flatten. Layer each evenly with pinch of shredded Mozzarella. Layer each with a single layer of pizza toppings. Repeat by layering each with another layer of sauce, quinoa, Mozzarella, pizza toppings, followed by a final layer of Mozzarella.  The ramekins should be full but not overflowing. Transfer the baking sheet full of ramekins to the oven, and bake for 20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the ingredients are heated through.  At this point, you can either remove the pizza bowls from the oven.  Or if you’d like to get the cheese extra golden on top, you can turn the oven to “broil”.  Then — keeping a close eye on the cheese so that it does not burn — broil the pizza bowls until the cheese is golden on top.

pizzas,Whole Wheat Pizza Dough,"Activate the yeast. (See notes below for alternate stand mixer instructions.) In a large mixing bowl, briefly whisk together the warm water, honey and yeast until combined. Let the mixture rest for 5 to 10 minutes or until the yeast is foamy. Add the dry ingredients. Add the white whole wheat flour, olive oil, salt and stir until a loose dough ball is formed. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead it by hand for 5 minutes until smooth. Let the dough rise. Rinse out and dry the earlier mixing bowl, then mist the bowl with olive oil or non-stick spray. Form the dough into a ball, place it in the greased bowl, then cover the bowl with a damp towel or aluminum foil. Let the dough rise for 30 to 45 minutes, or until it has nearly doubled in size. Prep the oven (and pizza stone, if using). Heat oven to 450°F. If using a pizza stone, be sure to place the stone in the cold oven and to allow it to heat gradually. Alternatively, you can bake the pizza on a flat baking sheet, which will not need to be preheated. Roll out the dough. Turn the dough back out onto a floured surface and use your hands to flatten it into a round disk. Using your hands or a rolling pin, gently stretch the dough evenly into a 12- to 14-inch round for a thick-crust pizza, pinching the outer edges up slightly to form a rim. (Alternatively, you can cut the dough in half and roll it into two rounds for two thin-crust pizzas.) Add toppings. Transfer the crust to a large baking sheet that has been lightly sprinkled with cornmeal. (Or if you are using a pizza stone, transfer the crust to a pizza peel that has been lightly sprinkled with cornmeal.) For an extra-golden crust, brush the outer rim of the crust lightly with olive oil. Add the sauce and toppings in the center of the pizza as desired.* Bake. Transfer the baking sheet to the oven (or slide the pizza from the peel to the stone) and bake the pizza for 16-18 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the toppings are melted and cooked.

main-course,Favorite Gumbo,"Brown the sausage. Heat a large heavy-bottomed stockpot over medium-high heat.  Add the sliced sausage in a single layer and briefly cook for 1 to 2 minutes per side, until lightly browned.  Transfer the sausage to a clean plate and set aside for later. Make the roux. Add the oil to the stockpot and whisk in flour until combined. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture reaches a dark brown color (similar to milk chocolate), about 20 to 30 minutes. Keep a very close eye on the roux as it cooks, adjusting the heat if it seems to be browning too slowly or too quickly, and whisk it constantly to be sure that it does not burn. Sauté the veggies. Once the roux reaches the dark brown color, immediately stir in the bell peppers, celery, and onion until combined.  Continue to cook, stirring every 10 to 15 seconds, until the vegetables have softened, about 6 to 8 minutes. Add in the garlic and cook for 1 more minute, stirring constantly. Add in the broth. Gradually add in the chicken stock, stirring in a few cups at a time so that the broth can thicken.

main-course,Sopa Azteca (Tortilla Soup),"Toast the chiles. Briefly toast the chiles by using tongs to carefully holding each chile an inch over a gas flame, turning for a few seconds until the chile is blistered and fragrant.  (Or alternately, if you have an electric stove, you can heat a skillet over medium-high heat and press the chiles down onto the hot skillet on each side for a few seconds until blistered and fragrant.)  Transfer the chiles to a blender or food processor and set aside. Sauté the veggies. Heat the olive oil in a large stockpot over medium-high heat.  Add the onion and sauté for 5 minutes until softened, stirring occasionally.  Add the garlic and sauté for 1-2 minutes more until fragrant, stirring frequently.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the mixture to the blender along with the chiles. Blend the broth. Add the tomatoes to the blender, along with 1 cup or so of the stock (enough to help the mixture purée easily).  Then purée until completely smooth and no large chile flakes remain. Simmer. Transfer the blended broth mixture to the stockpot, add the remaining stock, oregano and epazote sprig (if using).  Cook over medium-high heat until the broth reaches a simmer.  Then reduce heat to medium-low to maintain the simmer and cook, uncovered, for 10 minutes.

main-course,Mushroom “Carnitas”,"Slice and shred the mushrooms. Cut off the mushroom caps (if using king oyster mushrooms) and thinly slice them with a knife.  Use a fork to shred the mushroom stems into thin bite-sized pieces.  Add the shredded and sliced mushrooms to a large mixing bowl. Marinate the mushrooms. In a separate measuring cup or mixing bowl, whisk together the juice of one lime (about 2 tablespoons), beer, orange juice, oil, garlic powder, ground cumin, oregano, salt and black pepper until combined. Drizzle the marinade over the mushrooms, then toss gently until the mushrooms are evenly coated. Heat the oven. Heat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Cook the mushrooms. Let the mushrooms marinate for about 15-20 minutes while the oven heats.  Then transfer the mushrooms to a large baking sheet and spread them out in an even layer.  Bake for about 30 to 40 minutes, removing the mushrooms at the 20-minute mark to give them a brief stir, and then again every 5 minutes afterwards.  The mushrooms will likely be fairly juicy at the 20-minute mark, but don’t worry, the liquid will evaporate and they will become browned and crispy as time goes on.  Once the mushrooms are browned reach your desired level of crispiness around the edges, transfer the baking sheet to a wire baking rack.  (Please note that the cooking time here will completely depend on the thickness of your mushrooms and the size of your baking sheet. For the fastest cooking time, thinly shred/slice the mushrooms as use a large baking sheet so that the mushrooms can cook in a shallow, even layer.) Season. Drizzle the mushrooms evenly with the juice of the remaining lime (about 2 tablespoons) and sprinkle with cilantro, if desired.  Give the mushrooms a quick taste, and season with extra salt and pepper if needed. Serve. Serve warm in tacos, burritos, burrito bowls, quesadillas, enchiladas, salads, or whatever sounds good.  Enjoy!","2 pounds king oyster mushrooms (or baby bella or shiitake mushrooms) 2 fresh limes, divided 1/2 cup beer* 1/4 cup orange juice 2 tablespoons avocado oil (or olive oil) 2 teaspoons garlic powder 2 teaspoons ground cumin 1 teaspoon dried oregano 1 teaspoon fine sea salt 1/2 teaspoon black pepper chopped fresh cilantro, for topping"
main-course,Thai Chicken Curry,"Cook the chicken. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large stockpot over medium-high heat.  Season the chicken generously with a few pinches of salt and pepper, then add it to the stockpot and sauté for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until browned and cooked through.  Transfer the chicken to a clean plate and set aside. (I recommend prepping the other veggies while the chicken cooks, to save time.) Sauté the veggies. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the stockpot.  Add the onion and sauté for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the bell peppers, carrots and mushrooms and sauté for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened.  (I prefer my veggies to stay slightly crispy, but you can cook yours longer if desired.)  Add the garlic, ginger and Thai curry paste and sauté for 2 minutes, stirring often. Simmer. Add in the coconut milk and stir until the curry paste has evenly dissolved in the broth.  Continue cooking until the curry just barely reaches a simmer. Lower heat to medium-lower to maintain the simmer, then cook for 3 to 5 more minutes, until the veggies reach your desired level of softness. Season. Add in the cooked chicken and the juice of one lime.  Then give the curry a taste and season with extra salt, pepper, curry paste and/or lime juice, if needed. Serve. Serve warm with rice, rice noodles, bread, or on its own.  Garnish with lots of chopped fresh herbs on top plus extra lime wedges if desired.  Enjoy!","2 tablespoons olive oil, divided 1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts, diced into 1-inch pieces fine sea salt and freshly-cracked black pepper 1 small white onion, peeled and thinly sliced 2 bell peppers, cored and thinly sliced (I used one red and one yellow) 1 large carrot, thinly sliced into coins 8 ounces baby bella mushrooms, quartered 2 tablespoons grated or minced fresh ginger* 4 cloves garlic, minced 1/4 cup Thai red curry paste (or more/less, to taste) 2 (14-ounce) cans full-fat coconut milk* juice of 1 to 2 limes, to taste toppings: chopped fresh cilantro, fresh Thai basil, extra lime wedges"
main-course,Nut Roast,"Cook the lentils. Combine the lentils with 4 cups water and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium saucepan. Heat over medium-high heat until the water reaches a vigorous simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low to maintain the simmer, cover and cook until the lentils are completely tender, about 20-30 minutes. Drain the lentils completely using a strainer, and set aside until later. Prep oven and bread pan. Heat the oven to 375°F (190°C).  Line a 9 x 5-inch bread pan with parchment paper. Sauté the veggies and herbs. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large sauté pan.  Add the onion, carrot and bell pepper and sauté for 7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened.  Add the mushrooms and garlic and sauté for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are softened and most of the liquid in the pan has evaporated.  Add the spinach, sage, rosemary, smoked paprika, and thyme.  Sauté for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.  Remove pan from heat. Combine all ingredients. In a large mixing bowl, add the cooked lentils, cooked veggie mixture, nuts, dried apricots, and orange juice and zest.  Toss until the mixture is evenly combined. Taste and season. Before we add the eggs, go ahead and give the mixture a taste and season it with salt and pepper as needed.  (The level of saltiness will vary considerably based on the type of nuts you used, but you will likely need to add a generous amount of salt and pepper, so don’t be shy!) Purée or mash part of the mixture. If you own a food processor, transfer about 1/3 of the mixture to a food processor and pulse a few times until the mixture is fairly puréed.  (Or alternately, use a potato masher to mash about 1/3 of the mixture on one side of the mixing bowl until it is puréed.)  Stir the puréed mixture back into the overall mixture along with the whisked eggs until everything is evenly combined. Press the mixture into the pan. Transfer the entire nut loaf mixture into the prepared bread pan, packing it down fairly firmly (which will help the loaf to slice more easily later). Bake. Bake uncovered for about 45 minutes, or until the top is lightly browned and the loaf is cooked through.  (I also like to remove the roast about 5 minutes before it has finished baking to brush the top of the roast with a bit of melted butter or oil to help it crisp up on top during those final few minutes in the oven, but this step is totally optional. Alternately, if the top of the roast starts to get too browned during cooking, just gently lay a sheet of aluminum foil on top of the bread pan.) Rest the nut roast. Transfer the pan to a wire cutting rack and let the nut roast rest for about 15-20 minutes. Serve. Carefully lift the edges of the parchment paper up to remove the nut roast from the pan and transfer it to a cutting board.  Use a bread knife to slice the roast into your desired size of pieces.  Then serve warm with gravy or cranberry sauce and enjoy!","1 cup (200 grams) green or brown lentils, picked over and rinsed fine sea salt and freshly-cracked black pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 small white onion, peeled and finely diced 1 large carrot, finely diced 1 small red bell pepper, cored and finely diced 8 ounces (225 grams) baby bella mushrooms, finely chopped* 4 large cloves garlic, pressed or minced 2 large handfuls baby spinach, roughly chopped 3 tablespoons chopped fresh sage 2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary 1 teaspoon smoked paprika 1 teaspoon dried thyme 10 ounces (300 grams) mixed nuts, finely chopped* 5 ounces (140 grams) dried apricots, finely chopped zest and juice (about 1/4 cup) of 1 small orange 3 eggs, whisked*"

Combine everything. Transfer the cooked veggies to a large mixing bowl.  Add in the bread, cooked turkey, dried cranberries, and fresh herbs.  In a separate bowl, briefly whisk together the stock and eggs, then pour the mixture into the large mixing bowl.  Very gently, use a spatula to toss the mixture until it is evenly combined. Transfer it to the 9 x 13-inch baking dish and spread the casserole out in an even layer. Bake. Bake the casserole uncovered for 40 to 45 minutes, or until it is cooked through and the top is nice and golden.  (That said, if the top turns too brown or looks like it is about to burn, just gently lay a layer of aluminum foil on top of the casserole until it is done baking.) Make the gravy. While the casserole is in the oven, make the mushroom gravy according to recipe instructions. Serve. Once the casserole is ready to go, remove the dish from the oven and garnish with a drizzle of gravy and a sprinkle of chopped nuts, if desired.  Serve warm, drizzling each individual serving with extra gravy, and enjoy!","2 tablespoons olive oil 1 small white onion, peeled and diced 1 large sweet potato (about 1 pound), peeled, thinly-sliced and diced 2 cups chopped fresh green beans (about 4 ounces), ends trimmed off 6 cloves garlic, peeled and minced 3 stalks celery, diced fine sea salt and freshly-cracked black pepper 1 small loaf sourdough bread, cubed and dried-out* (about 6 cups) 1 pound diced cooked turkey (or see alternatives below) 2/3 cup dried cranberries 1/4 cup finely-chopped fresh herbs (such as rosemary, thyme, sage, etc) 2 cups chicken or vegetable stock 2 eggs 1 batch mushroom gravy optional: chopped toasted nuts, for sprinkling (such as pepitas, pecans, walnuts, etc)"

Slow cook. Cook on high for 1 to 2 hours, until the rice is cooked and tender. (Note: Our readers have found that the cooking time for this recipe can vary widely between different brands of slow cookers.  So I recommend testing the rice at the 1 hour point to see if it is close to being tender, and then every 20 minutes afterwards until the rice is ready to go. Alternately, if the rice cooks quickly and soaks up too much of the broth while cooking, feel free to add in an extra cup of vegetable broth.) Add final ingredients.

main-course,Brown Butter Lemon Pasta,"Cook the pasta. Heat a large stockpot of generously-salted water until boiling.  Add the pasta (at the same time you being browning the butter, see below) and cook until 2 minutes shy of al dente. Brown the butter. At the same time* that you add the pasta to the boiling water, begin cooking the butter in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat.  Continue cooking until the butter has melted and begins to foam, stirring frequently to ensure that the butter cooks evenly.  Add in the lemon zest and a few twists of black pepper and continue cooking the butter, stirring frequently, until it starts to turn golden brown and smells toasty.  (Keep a very close eye on the butter so that it does not burn; it can go from golden to burnt very quickly!) Add the remaining sauce ingredients. Using a heat-safe measuring cup, scoop out 1 cup of the starchy pasta water from the stockpot and immediately pour it into the brown butter mixture.  (Be careful and pour slowly because it will bubble.)  Let the mixture simmer and reduce for a few minutes until it has thickened slightly, stirring occasionally.  Add in the grated Parmesan and lemon juice and whisk until combined.

main-course,Carne Asada Tacos,"Make the carne asada. Marinate and cook the steak according to recipe instructions.

main-course,Carne Asada,"Make the marinade. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the garlic, lime juice, orange juice, jalapeño (if using), cilantro, oil, chili powder, cumin and oregano until combined. Marinate the steak. Place the flank steak in a shallow baking dish, pour the marinade evenly over the steak, and toss the steak until it is evenly coated in the marinade.  (Alternately, you can combine the steak and marinade in a large Ziplock or Stasher bag and toss to coat.)  Cover and refrigerate for 2 to 4 hours to marinate. Bring the steak back to room temperature. Remove the dish from the refrigerator, lift the steak out of the marinade and transfer it to a clean plate. Season each side with a few generous pinches of salt and pepper, then let the steak rest for 30 minutes or until it reaches room temperature. Cook the steak. Heat an outdoor grill or indoor grill pan (or cast-iron skillet or griddle) to high heat.  Cook the steak for 5-7 minutes per side — resisting the urge to move the steak as it cooks so that it can sear properly — until it reaches your desired level of doneness.  (See temperature chart below.) Rest the steak. Transfer the steak to a clean plate and let it rest for 10 minutes, which will help to seal in the juices. Slice/cut and serve. Then slice the steak against the grain as thickly or thinly as you prefer. (Or you can dice the steak into small pieces.)  Then serve and enjoy!","1 1/2 to 2 pounds flank steak 5 garlic cloves, minced 1 lime, juiced 1 orange, juiced 1 jalapeño, cored and finely minced (optional) 1/2 cup finely-chopped fresh cilantro 1/4 cup avocado oil (or olive oil) 1 teaspoon chili powder 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano coarse sea salt and black pepper, to taste"
main-course,"Pasta with Burst Cherry Tomatoes, Burrata and Basil","Cook the pasta (almost) al dente. Bring a large pot of generously-salted water to a boil.  Add the pasta and cook until 1 minute shy of al dente. Cook the tomatoes. Meanwhile, as soon as you add the pasta to the boiling water, begin cooking your tomato sauce.  Melt the butter (or olive oil) in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat.  Add the tomatoes and garlic.  Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 8 minutes or until the tomatoes begin to burst and release their juices to form a sauce.  Reduce heat to low, season with salt and pepper to taste (I added a generous pinch or two of each), then remove and discard the smashed garlic.  Let the tomato sauce continue cooking on low until the pasta is ready to go. Toss everything together.  Once the pasta is nearly al dente, use kitchen tongs to transfer the pasta directly into the tomato sauce and toss briefly to combine.  Tear the ball of burrata into 6 or 8 rough pieces (I recommend doing this directly over the pasta, so that any cream that escapes falls into the dish).  Then add the burrata, basil, 1/3 cup of the toasted pine nuts and 1/2 cup of the hot starchy pasta water to the pasta.  Toss until the pasta is evenly combined and al dente.  If the pasta seems too dry, just mix in more starchy pasta water as needed. Serve. Dish your servings up immediately while the pasta is hot and the cheese is still gooey.  Sprinkle each serving with the remaining pine nuts and enjoy!","1 pound uncooked pasta (I used bucatini) 2 tablespoons butter or olive oil 2 pints cherry tomatoes 6 cloves garlic, peeled and lightly smashed sea salt and freshly-cracked black pepper 1 large ball of fresh burrata cheese 2 cups (loosely packed) fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped 2/3 cup toasted pine nuts"

main-course,Easy Sushi Rolls,"Prep all of your ingredients. It’s important to have all of your ingredients prepped and ready to go before you begin to assemble your rolls.  (I especially recommend cooking the rice 1-2 hours ahead of time, so that it can cool to room temperature before assembling the rolls.) Press the rice. Lay a sheet of nori on a sushi mat* smooth-side-down, with the longer side of the nori facing you.  Place a bowl of water nearby.  Dip your fingers into the water (this will help the rice not to stick) and sprinkle approximately 1 cup of sushi rice evenly over the nori, leaving a 1-inch border open at the top.  Using your fingers, gently but firmly press the rice onto the nori in an even layer, dipping your fingers back into the water as often as needed so that they do not stick.  You want the rice to cover the nori as evenly as possible, all the way to the bottom, left and right edges of the sheet.  (See photos above.) Add the fillings. Place the fillings in long horizontal lines on top of the rice, layering the different fillings side by side instead of in one big pile.  Sprinkle the toppings a pinch of sesame seeds, if desired. Roll up the sushi. Lift up the bottom edge of the sushi mat and carefully fold it over the fillings until they are enclosed in a roll, yet still leaving the top 1-inch of the empty nori exposed.  Use the sushi mat to squeeze the roll in as tightly as possible.  (Although not too tight, as you don’t want all of the fillings to squish out!)  Dip your fingers in the water bowl once more and use them to wet the remaining 1-inch of nori.  Then use the sushi mat to finish rolling up the roll until it is completely enclosed.  Give it a few extra squeezes all around so that it is nice and firmly-packed.  Then transfer the entire roll to a cutting board. Repeat with the remaining ingredients to form about 5 sushi rolls. Cut the sushi. Using a very sharp knife, cut the each sushi roll into 8 equal(ish)-sized pieces.  Transfer them to your serving plate. Drizzle and garnish. Drizzle the sushi with the spicy mayo and/or sprinkle with extra toasted sesame seeds. Serve. Serve immediately, along with pickled ginger, wasabi paste, and soy sauce for dipping.

main-course,Baked Eggplant Parmesan,"Sweat the eggplant (optional). If you have extra time and would like to remove some of the bitterness of the eggplant, line a large sheet pan (or two half sheet pans) with paper towels and place the eggplant rounds on the sheet in an even layer. Sprinkle evenly and generously with salt, then let the eggplant rounds rest for 30-60 minutes so that the sometimes-bitter liquids inside can sweat out. Transfer the eggplant rounds to a colander and rinse with cold water to remove the salt, then pat the eggplant dry with a clean paper towels. Toast the Panko (optional). If you would like your Panko breadcrumbs to be extra crispy and golden, spread them out in an even layer on a sheet pan.  Bake at 400°F for 4 minutes or until golden, then remove the baking sheet and give the Panko a stir.  Bake for another 2-3 minutes or until golden, then remove, stir and set aside.  (The Panko will start to brown quickly, so keep a close eye on it while cooking to ensure that it does not burn.) Prep the oven and baking sheet(s). Heat oven to 425°F. Line a large sheet pan (or two half sheet pans) with parchment paper, and set aside. Bread the eggplant. In a shallow bowl, whisk together the Panko breadcrumbs, Italian seasoning, garlic powder and (1 teaspoon) fine sea salt and black pepper until combined. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs with 2 tablespoons water. Dip an eggplant round in the egg mixture so that is evenly coated on all sides, then transfer to the breadcrumb mixture and coat on all sides, then place it on the prepared baking sheet.* Repeat with the remaining eggplant rounds until they are all coated and evenly spaced on the baking sheet(s). Bake for 25 minutes, until the eggplant is softened and mostly cooked through.  Transfer baking sheet(s) to a wire rack and set aside. Layer the casserole. Spread 1/2 cup marinara sauce evenly across the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch baking dish.  Place half of the eggplant in an even-ish layer along the bottom of the dish, topped evenly with 1 cup marinara sauce, 1 cup Mozzarella, all of the Parmesan, and half of the basil, the remaining eggplant, remaining marinara sauce, and the remaining Mozzarella.

main-course,Flour Tortillas,"Mix the dough.  Briefly stir together the flour, sea salt and baking powder together in a large mixing bowl until combined.  Add the hot water and coconut oil and stir until a shaggy dough begins to form. Knead the dough. Turn the dough onto a floured surface, and use your hands to knead the dough for 1-2 minutes until it is fairly smooth. Rest the dough. Form the dough into a round ball and pat it down slightly so that it forms an evenly-thick disk. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let the dough rest for 10 minutes. Form the dough balls. Use a knife to cut the dough into 12 equal wedges.  Use your hands to roll a wedge into a roughly-shaped ball.  Then use a rolling pin or a tortilla press to roll the dough ball out into a 6-inch tortilla. Cook the tortillas. Heat a cast-iron skillet or heavy-bottomed sauté pan over medium-high heat.  Add the tortilla and cook for 30-60 seconds, until tiny little bubbles begin to appear on the surface and/or golden spots appear on the bottom of the tortilla.  Flip and cook on the second side for about 30 seconds, or until the bottom is also slightly golden.  Then transfer to a clean plate or bowl, cover with a clean dishtowel, and set aside.  Repeat with the remaining dough balls.  (I like to roll out the next tortilla while the current one is cooking, to save time.) Also, if the skillet seems to be getting too hot and cooking the tortillas too quickly, just reduce the heat. Serve. Serve warm and enjoy!  I recommend keeping the tortillas covered with a dishtowel or stored in a tortilla warmer until they are served, so that they can stay warm and not dry out.","3 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons fine sea salt 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 cup hot water 1/3 cup coconut oil (room temperature, not melted)"
main-course,Meatballs,"Make the panade.  In a large mixing bowl, stir together the panko and milk until combined.  Set mixture aside to soak for 5 to 10 minutes while you prepare the other ingredients. Combine remaining ingredients.  Add the ground beef, ground pork, garlic, eggs, Parmesan, fresh herbs, onion and Worcestershire sauce to the (same) mixing bowl.  Sprinkle the oregano, salt, black pepper and crushed red pepper flakes evenly on top.  Use your hands to mix the ingredients until evenly combined, being careful not to over-mix the ingredients. Chill (optional step).  To make the meatballs easier to form, I recommend covering and chilling the mixture in the refrigerator for 1 hour.  But if you’re pressed for time, you can skip this step. Prep oven and baking sheet.  Heat the oven to 425°F and line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Form the meatballs.  Using a medium cookie scoop or a spoon, scoop and roll the mixture into 2-tablespoon balls and place them on the prepared baking sheet.  (I recommend greasing your hands with a bit of olive oil to prevent the mixture from sticking.) Bake.  Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer measures the internal temperature of the meatballs to be 160°F.  Remove pan and transfer to a wire cooling rack. Serve.  Serve meatballs immediately and enjoy!","1 cup Panko breadcrumbs 1/3 cup milk 1 pound ground beef 1 pound ground pork 4 cloves garlic, pressed or minced 2 eggs 1 cup (1 1/2 ounces) finely-grated Parmesan cheese 1/4 cup finely-chopped fresh Italian herbs (I used half parsley, half basil) 1/4 cup grated yellow onion 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce 1 teaspoon dried oregano 1 teaspoon fine sea salt 1/2 teaspoon black pepper 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes"
main-course,Spaghetti Aglio e Olio,"Cook the spaghetti. Bring a large stockpot of generously-salted water to a boil.  Add spaghetti and cook until nearly al dente (like, just one minute shy of being done). Sauté the garlic.  Meanwhile, about 3 minutes after you add the pasta to the boiling water, heat the olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium heat.  Add the sliced garlic and crushed red pepper flakes and sauté for 3 to 5 minutes, or until it is lightly golden.  (It’s very important that the garlic not burn.  So if the pasta is not ready to go by the time the garlic is lightly golden, remove the sauté pan from the heat until the pasta is ready.) Toss the pasta in the sauce.  As soon as the pasta is ready to go, use tongs to transfer the pasta to the sauté pan, along with 1/2 cup of the hot starchy pasta water.  Toss the pasta continuously until it is evenly coated in the garlic sauce.  If the sauce looks a bit too dry, add in another 1/4 cup of the starchy pasta water. Taste and season.  Give the pasta a quick taste add an extra pinch of salt and/or crushed red pepper flakes if needed. Serve. Serve immediately while it’s nice and hot, garnished with any toppings that sound good.","1 pound dried spaghetti 1/2 cup good-quality olive oil 6 to 8 cloves garlic, very thinly sliced 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (or more, to taste) optional garnishes: chopped fresh parsley, freshly-grated Parmesan cheese"
main-course,No Knead Bread,"Mix the dough. Stir together the flour, salt and yeast in a large mixing bowl until combined.  Add in the warm water and stir with a wooden spoon or spatula until the dough is evenly mixed and no large flour streaks remain.  (The dough will look quite loose and shaggy, which is ok.) Let the dough rise.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or beeswrap, and let the dough rest at room temperature for 12 to 18 hours. Shape the dough.  Transfer the dough to a well-floured surface.  Fold the dough on top of itself — pulling the outer edges up and into the center a few times until the dough feels a bit tighter and holds its shape — to form a round dough ball.  (If the dough is sticky or feels too loose at any point, just keep sprinkling on extra flour as needed.)  Lightly flour the top of the dough ball, and then carefully flip it upside-down onto a piece of parchment paper, so that the smooth side is on top.  Use your hands to shape the ball into an even circle.  Lightly flour the top of the dough ball, then loosely cover it with plastic wrap or beeswrap to rest while the oven heats. Heat the oven and Dutch oven.  Place the Dutch oven inside of your oven*, then set oven to 450°F.  Wait for 20-30 minutes for the oven to heat, while the dough continues to rest.  (If the dough rises and spreads out more than you would like during this time, just use your hands to shape it into a tighter ball once more just before baking.) Bake. Very carefully, use oven mitts to remove the Dutch oven from the oven.  (It will be extremely hot!)  Lift the edges of the parchment to carefully transfer the dough ball (along with the parchment) to the Dutch oven.  Cover with the Dutch oven lid and bake for 30 minutes.  Then carefully remove the lid and bake for 10-20 more minutes, until the crust of the bread reaches your desired level of doneness (as light or as deeply golden brown and crispy as you prefer). Serve. Remove from the oven, uncover, and then carefully lift up the edges of the parchment to transfer the bread to a wire cooling rack.  Cool for at least 30 minutes, then slice, serve and enjoy!",3 1/4 cups (425 grams) all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons fine sea salt 1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast 1 1/2 cups warm water (about 110°F)

Simmer. Reduce heat to medium, in order to maintain the simmer.  Cover and simmer for 10 minutes, until the cabbage has completely softened. Make the egg ribbons.  Remove the lid.  Then, while the soup is still simmering, use one hand to continuously stir the soup round and round, creating a “whirlpool”-type motion, while you use your other hand to slowly drizzle in the whisked eggs.  The eggs will cook instantly in the hot broth, creating pretty egg ribbons. Season.  Stir in the sesame oil until completely combined.  Then give the soup a taste and season with salt, as needed, plus any extra sesame oil, white pepper or ginger that you think it might need. Serve.  Serve warm, garnished with green onions if desired.","1 tablespoon olive oil 1 small white onion, peeled and diced 3 cloves garlic, minced 8 cups vegetable stock (or chicken stock) 1 small head of Napa cabbage, roughly chopped 1 teaspoon ground ginger 1/4 teaspoon white pepper 3 eggs, whisked 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil optional topping: thinly sliced green onions"
main-course,Cacio e Pepe,"Cook the pasta.  In a large stockpot of generously-salted water, boil your pasta according to package instructions until it just barely al dente.  (Try to avoid overcooking the pasta.) Grate the cheese.  While the pasta water comes to a boil, finely-grate the cheese by hand. Reserve some of the starchy pasta water.  Once the pasta is about 1 minute away from being al dente, carefully scoop out 2 cups of the starchy boiling pasta water and transfer the water into a separate heat-proof container.  Set aside. Drain the pasta.  Drain the pasta using a colander.  Then transfer the pasta back to the hot stockpot, placed off of the hot burner. Add the butter, starchy water, cheese and black pepper.  Add in the diced butter and 1 cup of the starchy pasta water and toss quickly to combine.  Add in the cheese and black pepper and quickly toss to combine. Continue to gradually add in extra starchy pasta water, as needed, until the cheese has completely melted and turned into a silky sauce that coats the pasta evenly. Serve.  Dish up the hot pasta and serve immediately, garnished with extra cheese and black pepper if desired.","8 ounces pasta (I recommend bucatini, thick spaghetti, linguine or fettuccine) 3 tablespoons butter, diced into 1-tablespoon chunks* 1 teaspoon freshly-cracked coarse black pepper 2 ounces (about 1 cup) freshly-grated* Pecorino or Parmesan cheese"
main-course,Japchae (Korean Noodle Stir-Fry),"Cook the noodles: Cook the sweet potato noodles al dente, according to package directions, in a large stockpot of boiling water.  (Be careful not to overcook the noodles, or they will become mushy in the stir-fry.)  Transfer the noodles to a strainer, and rinse with cold water until chilled.  Strain out any extra water, drizzle the noodles with a drizzle of sesame oil, toss until the noodles are evenly coated, and set aside. Marinate the steak. Combine the steak, soy sauce, and a generous pinch and black pepper in a large bowl, and toss to combine.  Let the steak marinate for 5 minutes (or up to 30 minutes). Prep the sauce. Whisk all of the sauce ingredients together in a small bowl until combined. Stir-fry the steak. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large sauté pan over high heat.  Add the steak and sauté for 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until cooked through.  Transfer steak to a separate clean plate, and set aside. Stir-fry the veggies. Reduce heat to medium-high.  Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and the onion.  Sauté for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Then add in the mushrooms, bell pepper, carrot and garlic cloves and sauté for 4-5 more minutes, stirring occasionally, until the veggies reach your desired level of softness.  (I like mine to still be a touch crispy.)  Stir in the spinach, and cook for 2 more minutes, using tongs to toss the veggie mixture frequently, until the spinach has wilted. Combine everything. Remove pan from heat.  Add the cooked noodles, steak and sauce to the veggie mixture, and toss to combine. Taste and season.  Give the noodles a taste, and season with extra soy sauce and/or black pepper if needed.

main-course,Cashew Tofu,"Drain the tofu. Sandwich the block of tofu between a few layers of paper towels. Then place a cutting board on top of the tofu, and stack a few heavy cans or pots or whatever you can safely balance on the cutting board.  The idea is to put a lot of pressure/weight on the tofu, which will help the excess water to press out into the paper towels.  Let the tofu drain for at least 15-30 minutes. Make the stir-fry sauce.  Meanwhile, whisk all of the ingredients together in a small bowl (or shake them together in a mason jar) until combined. Coat the tofu.  Once the tofu has been drained, slice the block lengthwise into 1/2-inch slabs, then cut the tofu into bite-sized pieces.  Transfer the tofu to a large mixing bowl, drizzle it evenly with 1 tablespoon olive oil and toss until coated. Sprinkle the cornstarch plus a generous pinch of salt and pepper over the tofu, and toss until evenly coated. Cook the tofu: Heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat in a large non-stick skillet.  Add about half of the tofu (however much can fit in an even layer without overlapping) and sauté for about 4-5 minutes, flipping halfway through, until crispy and golden on both sides.  Transfer the tofu to a separate plate and repeat with the remaining tofu. Sauté the veggies.  Add the remaining oil to the sauté pan and add the broccoli, red pepper and red onion.  Sauté for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until crisp-tender. Combine everything.  Add the cashews, stir-fry sauce and cooked tofu to the sauteé pan, and toss to combine.  Continue cooking for 1-2 more minutes, until the sauce has thickened.

main-course,Instant Pot Shredded Chicken,"Combine the ingredients.  Add the chicken breasts, seasoning and chicken stock to the bowl of your pressure cooker.  Give everything a brief toss to combine, then arrange the chicken breasts so that they are spread out in an even layer. Pressure cook.  Cover and set the pressure cooker lid valve to “sealing.”  Pressure cook on high for 10 minutes, followed by a 5 minute natural release, followed by a quick release (carefully flip the valve to “venting”) to release whatever pressure remains. Shred.  Remove the lid and use two forks to shred the chicken.  Give it a thorough toss with the remaining juices in the pressure cooker. Serve or store.  Serve the chicken while it’s nice and warm.  Or transfer it to a sealed container and refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 3 months.  (If freezing, I recommend portioning the chicken in small storage containers or storage bags, so that you have the option to thaw and use small portions rather than having to thaw the entire batch.)",2 to 3 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts 1 cup chicken stock (or water) 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly-cracked black pepper 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika

Simmer.  Add the stock, red lentils, potato, and stir to combine.  Continue cooking until the soup reaches a simmer.  Reduce heat to medium-low to maintain the simmer, cover and cook for 15 minutes (or until the lentils are tender). Purée (optional).  If you would like to purée the soup, use an immersion blender to purée until completely smooth.  Or transfer the soup to a traditional blender (I recommend doing this in two batches, so as not to overfill the blender), and carefully purée* until smooth. Season.  Taste the soup, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve.  Serve warm, sprinkled with chopped fresh mint and fresh lemon wedges for squeezing.  (The lemon juice is essential, in my opinion, so be sure that it gets added to the soup!)","1 tablespoon butter (or olive oil) 1 medium white onion, peeled and diced 1 carrot, diced 1 tablespoon tomato paste (optional) 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon Aleppo pepper* 6 cups vegetable or chicken stock 1 cup red lentils, rinsed and picked over 1 small Yukon gold potato, diced into 1/2-inch cubes fine sea salt and freshly-cracked black pepper, to taste fresh lemon wedges and chopped fresh mint, for serving"

Bake for 25 minutes.  Remove baking sheet from the oven. Brush with butter (or oil).  Using a pastry brush, brush the outside of the potato with melted butter or olive oil until it is completely coated on all sides.  Sprinkle the potato with a generous pinch of Kosher salt, and place the potato back on the baking sheet reverse-side-up, so that it can cook evenly on both sides. Bake (round two).

main-course,The Juiciest Grilled Chicken Kabobs,"To brine the chicken breasts, fill a large bowl with 1 quart of warm water and 1/4 cup kosher salt.  Stir to combine until most of the salt is absorbed.  Add the whole chicken breasts and let them sit in the mixture to brine for 15 minutes.  Or you can also also cover the bowl and refrigerate for up to 6 hours.  Remove the chicken breasts from the brine, rinse them with cold water, then pat them dry with some paper towels.  (If the chicken breasts you purchased have already been pre-brined in a sodium solution, skip this brining step completely.) Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.  If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 15 minutes before using. Cut the chicken breasts into 1-inch pieces.  Add them to a large mixing bowl and drizzle evenly with the olive oil.  Toss to combine. In a separate small bowl, whisk together the salt, pepper, garlic powder and paprika until combined.  Sprinkle the seasoning mixture evenly over the chicken.  Then toss for 1 minute, or until the chicken is evenly coated with the seasoning.  Thread the chicken evenly onto the skewers. Once the grill is hot, place the chicken kabobs evenly on the grill.  Cook for 10-14 minutes, turning once halfway through, until the chicken is golden brown and cooked through (no longer pink on the inside). Transfer the kabobs to a clean plate, and loosely tent with aluminum foil.  Let the chicken rest for at least 5-10 minutes.

main-course,20-Minute Ricotta Gnocchi,"Prep the water: Bring a large stockpot of generously-salted water to a boil over high heat. Drain the ricotta: While your water is heating, place 3-4 paper towels on a large plate and spread the ricotta on the paper towels in an even layer.  Place another layer of 3-4 paper towels on top of the ricotta.  Then press down gently to let the excess moisture soak into the paper towels, trying to soak up as much of the excess liquid as possible.  Transfer the ricotta to a large mixing bowl.  (If it sticks to the paper towels, just use a rubber spatula to scrape it off.)  The drained ricotta should now weigh about 12 ounces. Mix your dough ingredients. Add the egg yolks to the ricotta and stir briefly to combine.  Add in the flour, Parmesan, salt and pepper, and stir until evenly combined.  Avoid over-mixing.  The dough will be a bit moist and maybe a bit sticky, but it should be holding together well.  If it feels too wet, just add in another few tablespoons of flour. Roll out and cut the dough.  Shape the dough into a round disk with your hands, then transfer it to a lightly-floured cutting board and sprinkle the dough with lightly with flour.  Using a knife or a bench scraper, cut the dough into eight even pie wedges.  Using your hands, gently roll out each wedge out into an even log, approximately 3/4-inch wide.  Cut each log into individual bite-sized little gnocchi squares.  Lightly dust the gnocchi with flour once more and give them a quick toss so that they are all lightly coated with flour.  (This will help prevent them from sticking together.) Boil the gnocchi. Carefully transfer the gnocchi to the boiling water to cook.  Then once they float — usually after 30 seconds or so — drain the gnocchi. Serve.  Serve immediately, tossed with your favorite sauce and whatever other ingredients sound good!",1 1/2 cups (one 15-ounce container) whole milk ricotta cheese 3 egg yolks 1 cup (about 4 ounces) ‘00’ flour or all-purpose flour* 3/4 cup (about 1 ounce) freshly-grated Parmesan 3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly-cracked black pepper
main-course,Homemade Pasta,"How To Make Pasta In A Food Processor:  Add all ingredients to the bowl of a food processor, fitted with the normal blade attachment.  Pulse for about 10 seconds, or until the mixture reaches a crumbly texture (see photos above). Remove the dough and form it into a ball with your hands, then place the dough on a lightly-floured cutting board. Knead the dough for 1-2 minutes until it is smooth and elastic. (If the dough seems too dry, add in an extra tablespoon or two of water.  If the dough seems wet or sticky, just add in some extra flour, but you the dough to be fairly dry.) Form the dough into a ball with your hands and wrap it tightly in plastic wrap. Let the dough rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.  Use immediately or refrigerate for up to 1 day. Roll out the pasta dough into your desired shape, either by hand or using a pasta maker (see notes above).  Cook the pasta in a large pot of generously-salted boiling water until it is al dente, usually between 1-5 minutes depending on the thickness of your pasta.  Drain and use immediately.  How To Make Pasta In A Stand Mixer:  Add all ingredients to the bowl of a stand mixer, fitted with the dough hook.  Knead the dough on low speed for 8-10 minutes until it is smooth and elastic.

How To Make Pasta By Hand:  Place the flour in a mound on a large cutting board.  Use your fingers or a spoon to create a good-sized well in the middle of the flour mound (kind of like a volcano).  Add the eggs in the center of the well.  Sprinkle the salt and drizzle the olive oil on top of the eggs. Use a fork to begin whisking the eggs until they are combined.  Then begin to gradually whisk some of the surrounding flour into the egg mixture, adding more and more until the egg mixture is nice and thick.  (If some eggs accidentally spill out, no worries, just use your hands or a bench scraper to pull them back in.)  Use your hands to fold in the rest of the dough until it forms a loose ball.  Knead the dough for about 10 minutes or until the dough is smooth and elastic, sprinkling some extra flour on the cutting board if needed to prevent sticking or if they dough seems too wet or sticky.  (That said, if the dough seems too dry, add in an extra tablespoon or two of water, but you want the dough to be fairly dry.)

main-course,Lasagna,"Make the sauce: In a large sauté pan or stockpot, cook the sausage and onion over medium-high heat until the sausage is completely browned, crumbling it with a wooden spoon as it cooks.  Add the garlic, tomato paste and crushed red pepper flakes and sauté for 2 more minutes, stirring occasionally.  Stir in the wine, using a wooden spoon to scrape up any of the browned bits that have stuck to the bottom of the pan. Add the tomatoes, roasted red peppers, oregano, bay leaf, salt and pepper, and stir to combine.  Use the wooden spoon to break up the tomatoes into small pieces as the sauce continues to cook.  Once the sauce reaches a simmer, reduce heat to medium to maintain the simmer.  Then let the sauce continue to simmer and reduce down for about 10-15 minutes, or until about half of the juices have evaporated.  (You still want the sauce to be fairly juicy, just not overly so.)  Discard bay leaf.  Remove pan from heat and set aside until ready to use. Make the cheese mixture: Meanwhile, in a separate mixing bowl, stir together the ricotta, Parmesan, basil and egg until combined.

main-course,Vegetarian Moo Shu,"To Make The Moo Shu:  Prepare the crispy tofu (if using) and sauce.  See instructions below. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large non-stick sauté pan over medium heat.  Add the whisked eggs and let then cooked undisturbed for 2-3 minutes until they are mostly set and form an omelet.  Flip the omelet and cook for 1 more minute on the second side.  Then transfer the omelet to a separate cutting board, and roughly chop it into small, thin pieces.  Set aside. Return the pan to the stove, and increase heat to high heat.  Add 1 more tablespoon of oil and heat until shimmering.  Then add the mushrooms and sauté for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until cooked and lightly browned.  Add the coleslaw and half of the scallions.  Saute for 2-3 minutes more, or until the cabbage has softened to your liking. Add in the cooked tofu, 2/3 of the sauce, half of the green onions.  Toss until combined. Taste and season with additional salt and pepper if needed. Serve over flour tortillas, lettuce cups, rice, or quinoa.  Drizzle with the remaining sauce, and sprinkle with your desired garnishes.  Then serve warm and enjoy!  To Make The Crispy Tofu:  Slice your block of tofu into 1/4-inch-thick slabs.  Lay some paper towels or a clean tea towel on a large flat surface, like a cutting board, and lay the slabs in a single layer on top of the paper towels.  Cover with another layer of paper towels.  Then place a second cutting board on top of the tofu, and stack a bunch of heavy cans or pots or whatever you can safely balance on top of the cutting board.  The idea is to put a lot of pressure/weight on the tofu, which will help the excess water to press out into the paper towels.  Let the tofu drain for at least 15-30 minutes. Once the tofu is ready to go, slice it into your desired shapes.  (I made thin strips, which you can see in the photos above.)  Add the tofu to a large mixing bowl, sprinkle it evenly with the cornstarch, salt and pepper.  Then toss until the tofu is evenly coated in the cornstarch mixture. Heat oil in a large non-stick sauté pan over medium-high heat.  Add the tofu and arrange it in a single layer.  (You may need to do this in two batches if your pan isn’t large enough for the tofu to all fit in a single layer.)  Cook the tofu undisturbed until it is browned on the bottom side, about 2 minutes.  Flip the tofu and cook until the second side is browned, about 1-2 minutes.  Give the whole mixture a gentle toss and cook for 1 more minute, stirring occasionally, until the tofu is browned to your liking. Transfer the tofu to a clean plate and set aside until ready to use.

Cook the bottom of the tortilla.  Add the remaining oil to the skillet and reduce the heat to medium.  Pour the egg mixture into the skillet and use a spatula to spread it out so that it is in an even layer.  Let the tortilla cook over medium heat for about 2-3 minutes, or until the bottom of the tortilla is lightly golden.  (You can gently lift up the edge of the tortilla with the spatula to take a peek and see if it’s ready to go.)  The top of the tortilla will still be a bit wet, which is ok. Flip the tortilla.  Carefully place a large plate face-down directly on top of the skillet.  Then — with one hand holding the skillet handle, and one hand firmly holding the plate on top of it — very carefully and quickly flip them both 180°, so that the plate is on the bottom and the skillet is upside-down on top.  (I like to do this over the sink, just in case any oil or egg spills out.)  If the bottom of the tortilla is cooked, the tortilla should fall easily onto the plate, with maybe just a bit of runny egg or oil leaking out. Cook the other side of the tortilla.  Return the skillet to the heat, and slide the tortilla from the plate back into the skillet to cook the second side.  Run a spatula around the edges of the tortilla to tuck the sides back under so that the edges are nice and rounded.  Cook for another 2 minutes, until the bottom of the tortilla is also lightly golden.  Then slide the tortilla onto a clean plate.

main-course,Baked Tofu,"Drain the tofu. Slice your block of tofu into 2 or 3 even slabs (depending on the shape of your tofu block, each slab should be about 3/4 to 1-inch thick).  Lay some paper towels or a clean tea towel on a flat surface, and place the slabs side by side on top of the paper towels.  Cover with another layer of paper towels.  Then place a cutting board on top of the tofu, and stack a bunch of heavy cans or pots or whatever you can safely balance on the cutting board.  The idea is to put a lot of pressure/weight on the tofu, which will help the excess water to press out into the paper towels.  Let the tofu drain for at least 15-30 minutes.  Meanwhile, heat your oven to 400°F. Cut the tofu. Once the tofu has drained, remove the weights and paper towels.  And use a knife to cut the tofu into your desired shapes.  I typically just make little cubes (about 3/4-inch each), but you can cut any size of triangles, rectangles, or other shapes that you’d like. Coat the tofu. Add your tofu to a large mixing bowl.  Drizzle with olive oil, and toss until evenly coated.  Sprinkle evenly with cornstarch, salt, garlic powder and black pepper.  Gently toss until the tofu is evenly coated. Arrange on a baking sheet. Turn the tofu out onto a parchment-covered baking sheet, and arrange it so that the tofu is in an even layer (not touching). Bake until crispy. Bake for 15 minutes.  Then remove the baking sheet from the oven, and flip each of the tofu bites so that they can cook evenly on the other side.  Return to the oven for 15-20 more minutes, or until the tofu reaches your desired level of crispiness.  Remove baking sheet from the oven. Serve warm.  And enjoy!",1 block (about 14 ounces) extra-firm tofu 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 tablespoon cornstarch 1 teaspoon fine sea salt 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

Brush the salmon on all sides (except the bottom) with oil.  Sprinkle each filet with a generous pinch of salt and black pepper, along with any other dry seasonings you prefer. Bake until the internal temperature of the salmon reaches 135-140°F*, about 4-6 minutes per half inch of thickness (measured by the thickest part of the filet).  You can also test for doneness by inserting a fork or knife in the salmon and twisting it a bit; the fish should be opaque and flake easily. Remove pan from the oven and transfer the salmon to a clean serving plate, either with the skin or leaving the skin behind.  Sprinkle each filet with a good squeeze of lemon juice, plus any extra fresh herbs or sauce that you prefer.  Then serve warm and enjoy!","4 salmon filets, skin-on (about 6–8 ounces each) 2 tablespoons high-heat oil, such as avocado oil or canola oil Kosher salt and freshly-cracked black pepper fresh lemon wedges"

Heat the oven. Preheat oven to 450°F. Season the chicken. Place the chicken breasts in a single layer in a large baking dish*.  Brush on both sides (turning once) evenly with the melted butter or olive oil.  In a separate small bowl, whisk the salt, pepper, garlic powder and paprika until combined.  Then sprinkle the mixture evenly over the chicken on both sides. Bake. Bake for 15-18* minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and no longer pink.  Cooking time will depend on the thickness of the chicken breasts, so I recommend using a cooking thermometer to know exactly when it is fully cooked.  The thickest part of the breast, it should be 165°F.  (Or, if you want the chicken to be a little bit browned and crispier on top, you can turn the broiler on high for the final 3-5 minutes and broil the chicken until it is cooked through and golden on top.  Keep a close eye on the chicken so that it does not overcook and/or burn.)

main-course,How To Make Tamales,"Soak the corn husks.  Place the corn husks in a large stockpot or pan and cover completely with warm water.  Soak for 30 minutes or so until softened. Mix the masa (dough).  Meanwhile, in the bowl of a large stand mixer, add masa marina, salt, cumin, baking powder, and whisk to combine.  Add the oil, then beat on low speed until combined.  Then gradually add the stock, and beat on low speed until combined.  Once the stock is incorporated, increase speed to medium, and beat for 10 minutes until fluffy, stopping occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl if needed.  Cover the mixing bowl with a damp paper towel and refrigerate until ready to use. Prepare your filling: Toss together your desired filling(s) and sauce until combined.  In general, you want enough sauce to coat and flavor the filling, but not so much that the filling is really juicy/watery. Assemble the tamales: To assemble the tamales, follow these simple steps (visual included in the blog post above):  Lay the soaked corn husk on a flat surface.  A simple plate or cutting board will do. Spread your masa on the corn husk.  About 1/4 cup (or a little more) will do.  I highly recommend using a large cookie scoop to measure out the masa.  Use a spoon or your fingers to spread it out into a rectangle large enough to enclose your filling.  (I keep a little bowl of water nearby to dip my fingers regularly, which helps the masa from sticking to them.) Add your filling/sauce to the center of the masa.  Tamales use surprisingly little filling — just a tablespoon or two will do.  Add it to the center of your masa. Fold the corn husk in half vertically.  Then very carefully, fold the corn husk in half so that the masa wraps completely around the filling, maybe using your fingers to pinch it together just a little bit. Wrap the corn husk into a little burrito.  Continue folding the corn husk completely over to one side so that it is a burrito/cylinder shape. Fold the top (skinny) end down to enclose one end of the tamale.  The image above explains this best.  One end of the tamale will be exposed, and the other will be folded over.  (I like to fold my tamales to cover the side with the seam. Tie the tamale together.  I like to shred a few corn husks into long skinny strips to tie the tamales together (this is a perfect use for the husks that are too skinny!).  But you can also use baking string.   Steam the tamales: Add water to the bottom of a stockpot or Instant Pot.  Then add a steamer basket, fill it with your tamales, and steam until the tamales are hot and cooked through and the masa separates easily from the corn husks, about 30 minutes on the stovetop or 20 minutes (high pressure, natural release) in the Instant Pot. Serve tamales: Remove from the steamer and serve immediately.  Or refrigerate in a tightly-sealed ziplock bag for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.","1 package dried corn husks 6 cups masa harina 2 teaspoons Kosher salt 2 teaspoons ground cumin 1 teaspoon baking powder 6 cups chicken or vegetable stock 3/4 cup corn oil (or avocado oil, olive oil, or any mild-flavored oil) 2–3 cups filling (see ideas below) 1 cup salsa (see ideas below)"
main-course,Mango Avocado Spring Rolls (with Easy Peanut Sauce),"To Make The Peanut Sauce: Whisk all ingredients together in a small bowl until combined.  If you would like a thinner sauce, whisk in more water. To Make The Spring Rolls: Cook thin rice vermicelli noodles according to package directions.  Once they are al dente, transfer the noodles to a strainer and rinse with cold water until the noodles are completely chilled.  Toss the thoroughly with a drizzle of oil (I like using sesame oil) to prevent the noodles from sticking together.  Set aside. Fill a large shallow pan with warm water (a sauté pan or pie dish works great).  Lay a spring roll wrapper in the hot water and let it rest there for about 20-30 seconds until soft, but not mushy.  Transfer the spring roll wrapper to plate (or a clean towel spread out on a flat surface, which will help the wrapper not to stick). Arrange your fillings in the center of the wrapper in a vertical line.  Fold in the top and bottom sides of the wrapper.  Then fold over the left side of the wrapper, tightly tucking in the fillings, and roll the wrapper to the right until it is sealed.

In a small saucepan, heat butter over medium-high heat until melted.  Stir in the garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.  (You want the garlic to be partly- but not fully-cooked.)  Remove from heat and stir in the white wine and lemon juice. Using a pastry brush, brush a tablespoons of the butter mixture on the foil until it is evenly covered.  Lay the salmon out on the foil.  Then pour the remainder of the butter-garlic mixture on top of the salmon and brush it around until it evenly covers the salmon.  Season the salmon evenly with a few generous pinches of salt and pepper. Fold the sides of the aluminum foil up and over the top of the salmon until it is completely enclosed.  (If your sheet of foil is not large enough, just place a second sheet of foil on top and fold the edges so that it forms a sealed packet. To Cook In The Oven: Bake for 14-15 minutes, or until the salmon is almost completely cooked through.  (Cooking times will vary on the thickness of your salmon, so I recommend checking it a few minutes early if you have a thinner cut of salmon.)  Remove the salmon from the oven and carefully open and pull back the aluminum foil so that the top of the fish is completely exposed.  (Be careful, lots of hot steam will be released!)  Change the oven setting to broil, then return the fish to the oven and broil for 3-4 minutes, or until the top of the salmon and the garlic are slightly golden and the fish is cooked through.  (Keep a close eye on the salmon while broiling, though, to be sure that the garlic does not burn.)

main-course,Spicy Baked Chicken Parmesan,"To Make The Spicy Baked Chicken Parmesan:  Preheat oven to 425°F.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, or spray it with cooking spray. Begin by making the crispy panko crust, as described below. Spread the flour out evenly on a plate, add the eggs to a medium bowl, and spread the (prepared) panko mixture out on a plate. Season the chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper. Dip one chicken breast in the flour until it is evenly coated on all sides, shaking off the excess.  Then dip it in the whisked eggs until it is completely coated.  Then finally dip it in the panko mixture until it is evenly coated on all sides, and place it on the prepared baking sheet.  Repeat with the remaining chicken breasts. Mist the chicken breasts with some cooking spray (or I like to use an olive oil mister). Bake for 20 minutes, flipping the chicken over after 15 minutes.  Then remove from oven, and spread a large spoonful of the spicy marinara sauce on top of each chicken breast, followed by about 1/4 cup of the shredded mozzarella. Bake for another 5 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and no longer pink inside. Remove and sprinkle with fresh basil and (if desired) extra crushed red pepper flakes.  Serve immediately.  To Make The Crispy Panko :  Preheat oven to 425°F.

Then reduce heat to medium-low and continue to let the sauce simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the oil on the surface is a deep orange. It will be reduced and thickened. Discard the sprig of basil, and season the sauce with additional salt and pepper if needed. Remove from heat and serve immediately, or store in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

main-course,Super-Easy Blueberry Almond Tart,"To Make The Blueberry Almond Tart: Preheat oven to 400°F.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and set aside. Lay out the thawed puff pastry sheet on a floured surface, and gently use a rolling pin to even out the creases and roll it out until it forms about an 11 x 18-inch rectangle.  Transfer the puff pastry to the prepared baking sheet.  Use a knife to score a very thin border around the outside of puff pastry.  Then use a fork to poke lots of holes into middle of pastry, to minimize inflation. Use a pastry brush to brush the whisked egg whites all over the top of the puff pastry.  Then transfer it to the oven and bake according to package directions until it is turns golden, about 10-12 minutes, keeping an eye on it while baking to be sure that it doesn’t puff up.  (If it does, just pull it out of the oven and use a spatula to pat it back down until it’s flat, repeating if needed.)  Remove and let cool for 5 minutes. While the puff pastry is baking, prepare your cream cheese spread, reserving part of it (as directed below) to make a glaze. Once the puff pastry is ready, spread the cream cheese spread evenly on top of the pastry.  Then sprinkle the fresh blueberries, blueberry almonds, and toasted coconut evenly on top of the cream cheese.  Drizzle the glaze evenly on top. Slice and serve immediately. To Make The Cream Cheese Spread/Glaze: Whisk all ingredients together in a bowl or measuring cup until smooth.  Taste, and add extra honey if needed to sweeten. Transfer 1/4 of the cream cheese spread mixture to a separate bowl, and whisk in a teaspoon at a time of milk until the mixture reaches more of a glaze-like consistency.  (If it accidentally gets too thin, you can add in a few spoonfuls of powdered sugar to thicken.)  This will be your glaze for the final step of the recipe.","Blueberry Almond Tart Ingredients:  1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed 1 egg white, whisked 1 batch cream cheese spread/glaze (see below) 2 cups fresh blueberries 1 cup Blue Diamond Oven-Roasted Blueberry Almonds, roughly-chopped 2/3 cup toasted coconut flakes  Cream Cheese Spread/Glaze Ingredients:  1/2 cup low-fat cream cheese, softened 1/2 cup non-fat plain Greek yogurt 2–3 tablespoons honey (add more/less to taste) 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, store-bought or homemade (add later: 1-3 teaspoons milk)"

main-course,Chipotle Sofritas Tacos,"How To Make The Sofritas Tacos:  Roll up the block of tofu in a few layers of paper towels, then place the covered tofu on a plate and place something heavy on top of it to help it drain.  I usually use a plastic cutting board on top, covered with a few cookbooks.  Let the tofu drain for at least 15 minutes, replacing the paper towels if they get too wet.  (*To speed this up even more, cut the tofu into four skinny rectangles, and do the same process with them.  The tofu will drain faster if it’s not quite as thick.) While the tofu is draining, make the chipotle sauce (see below). When you’re ready to cook the sofritas, heat the oil over medium-high heat in a stockpot or large saute pan.  Add the tofu and red pepper and saute for 5-7 minutes, gently stirring every minute or so, until the tofu is cooked and slightly browned around the edges, and the red pepper is cooked and softened. Add in the beans and chipotle sauce, and stir to combine.  Continue cooking over medium-high heat until the sauce reaches a simmer.  Then reduce heat to medium-low and simmering for 5 more minutes.

main-course,Baked Lemon Chicken,"*To brine your chicken breasts, simply fill a large bowl with 1 quart of warm water and 1/4 cup kosher salt.  Stir to combine until most of the salt is absorbed.  Add the chicken breasts and let them sit in the mixture to brine for 15 minutes.  Or you can also also cover the bowl and refrigerate for up to 6 hours.  Remove the chicken breasts from the brine, rinse them with cold water, then pat them dry with some paper towels. Heat oven to 450°F. In a medium bowl, whisk together the garlic, melted butter, lemon juice, and thyme until combined.  Set aside. Pour the melted butter mixture into a large baking dish, and place the chicken breasts on top of it in an even layer.  Use a pastry brush to brush the butter mixture all over the chicken breasts until they are completely coated on both sides.  Then sprinkle each chicken breast evenly with a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Then feel free to add in a few extra lemon slices to the mix to look pretty when it all bakes up.  (Although disclaimer — I don’t recommend eating these or laying them directly on top of the chicken breasts, since they get a little bitter the longer they cook.) Bake for 5 minutes.  Then remove the pan from the oven and brush the chicken again thoroughly with the butter mixture.  Bake again for 5 minutes, remove and brush.  Bake again for 5-8* minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and no longer pink.  (So the chicken will bake for 15-18 minutes total.  If you use a cooking thermometer to measure the temperature thickest part of the breast, it should be between 160-170°F.  The FDA recommends 170°F.) *Or, if you want the chicken to be a little bit browned and crispier on top, you can turn the broiler on high for the final 3-5 minutes and broil the chicken until it is cooked through and extra browned on top.  Keep a close eye on the chicken so that it does not overcook and/or burn. Once the chicken is cooked, remove the pan from the oven and brush the chicken thoroughly with the butter mixture once more.  Loosely cover the pan with aluminum foil, and let the chicken rest for at least 5-10 minutes.  Serve immediately, garnished with extra lemon slices and thyme sprigs if desired.

main-course,Vegan Enchiladas,"To Make The Enchilada Sauce:  Heat a large skillet over medium heat.  Once hot, add the oil, onion, and garlic.  Cook, stirring frequently, until soft and translucent, 4-5 minutes. Add the tomato sauce, chipotle pepper, adobo sauce, maple syrup, and water.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes, covered (to prevent splattering). Transfer the sauce to the bowl of a blender (optional) and blend well.  Taste and adjust the seasonings as needed, adding more adobo sauce for heat, salt for savoriness, and/or maple syrup for sweetness if needed.  Set aside.  To Make The Enchilada Filling:  Rinse the skillet slightly and place over medium heat to prepare the filling.  Also preheat the oven to 350°F (176°C). Once the skillet is hot, add the oil, onion and poblano pepper.  Season with a pinch each of salt and pepper.  Cook until the onion is translucent and the pepper has a bit of color, about 3-4 minutes. Add the refried beans and stir/mash to combine.  Add 1/3 cup (~90 ml) of the enchilada sauce for extra flavor.  Taste and adjust the seasonings as needed.  Remove from the heat and set aside. Wrap the tortillas in a damp paper or cloth towel and microwave to warm for 30 seconds.  (Alternatively, place the tortillas directly on the oven rack for 1 minute to heat through.) Pour a bit of sauce into the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch (3-quart) baking dish.  Spread to coat.  Take one corn tortilla and lay it down in the dish.  Fill with a modest amount of filling (keeping in mind there needs to be enough for 8-10 tortillas), then roll up the tortilla.  Place the seam-side down at one end of the dish.  Continue until all of the tortillas are filled and wrapped, adding more sauce as needed. Pour the remaining sauce over the top of the enchiladas in a stripe down the middle.  Brush/spray the edges with oil for crisp edges (optional). Bake at 350°F (176°C) for 15-20 minutes, or until warmed through.  Top with desired toppings and serve.

In a separate small mixing bowl, add the goat cheese, milk, 1/4 cup Parmesan and 1/2 cup of the reserved hot pasta water.  Whisk until combined. Once the pasta is cooked and drained, immediately add the chicken, vegetable mixture and the goat cheese sauce to the pasta, and toss to combine.  If the sauce is too thick, you can stir in an extra 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the reserved hot pasta water to thin it out.  Otherwise, serve immediately, garnished with extra Parmesan and black pepper, if desired.","1 pound (16 ounces) pasta (I used farfalle) 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts salt and freshly-ground black pepper 1 shallot, peeled and minced 6 cloves garlic, peeled and minced 1 bunch (about 1 pound) asparagus, cut into bite-sized pieces, ends trimmed off 16 ounces (2 cartons) fresh baby bella or white button mushrooms, halved 8 ounces goat cheese 1/3 cup milk 1/2 cup freshly-grated Parmesan cheese, divided"
main-course,Pad See Ew,"To Make The Stir-Fry:  Prepare noodles al dente according to package instructions.  (Or if there are no instructions, I recommend placing the noodles in a large mixing bowl and pouring boiling water on top of them until they are submerged.  Wait 3-5 minutes until they are soft and al dente, then drain the water and set the noodles aside until ready to use, breaking them up with your fingers so that they don’t stick together.)

While the butternut squash are roasting, bring a large stockpot of generously-salted water to a boil over high heat.  (*See tip below about starting the alfredo sauce at this point.)  Add the jumbo shells and cook al dente (or ideally cook until just a minute before they reach al dente) according to package instructions.  Drain. In a 9×13-inch baking dish (or I used an oval dish), spread out 1/2 cup of the remaining alfredo sauce in an even layer.  Stuff a tablespoon or two of the butternut filling inside each of the shells, and lay them in an even layer in the baking dish, filling-side-up.  Spoon the remaining alfredo sauce evenly on top.  (Optional: if using the mozzarella, sprinkle it on top of the alfredo sauce.)  Then sprinkle the Panko mixture evenly over the top of everything. Bake uncovered for 15 minutes, or until the Panko mixture is crispy and starts to turn slightly golden.  Remove and serve immediately.  To Make The Alfredo Sauce:  Heat olive oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add garlic and saute one minute, stirring occasionally, until fragrant. Sprinkle with flour, and stir to combine. Saute for an additional minute to cook the flour, stirring occasionally. Slowly add chicken broth, whisking to combine until smooth. Whisk in milk and sage, and bring the mixture to a simmer. Let cook for an additional minute until thickened, then stir in Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper until the cheese melted.  Reduce heat to low and simmer until ready to use. (*For timing, I recommend making the alfredo sauce simultaneously with bringing the pasta water to a boil and cooking the pasta.)","Stuffed Shells Ingredients:  1/4 cup Panko breadcrumbs 1 Tablespoon butter, melted 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, homemade or store-bought 1/4 teaspoon salt 6 ounces jumbo shells 6 cloves garlic, peeled 1 medium butternut squash, peeled, seeded and diced into 1/2-inch cubes (see my tutorial here) salt and pepper 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 batch Skinny (Sage) Alfredo Sauce, recipe below (optional: 1 cup shredded part-skim Mozzarella cheese)  Skinny (Sage) Alfredo Sauce Ingredients:   1 Tbsp. olive oil 4 cloves garlic, pressed or minced 3 Tbsp. flour 1 cup chicken or vegetable stock 1 cup low-fat milk (I used 1%) 1 Tablespoon chopped fresh sage (or 1 teaspoon dried sage) 3/4 cup freshly-grated Parmesan cheese 1/2 tsp. salt 1/4 tsp. black pepper"

main-course,Cranberry Orange Cheesecake,"To Make The Orange Cheesecake:  Preheat oven to 350°F. Use a food processor to combine ground gingersnaps, butter and salt. (Or stir together in a large mixing bowl until combined.) Press mixture firmly into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan (or up the sides, if desired). Bake for 10 minutes, then remove and let cool. Reduce oven heat to 325°F. Once the pan reaches room temperature, carefully wrap the outside of the pan in 2 layers of heavy-duty aluminum foil, being sure that there are NO gaps where water could seep through. (**If you are doubtful about this step, read in notes below for an alternative water bath in which the pan does not actually touch water.**) Place the pan in a large roasting dish (or any pan larger than the springform), and bring a tea kettle or pot of water to boil in preparation for the water bath. Set aside. Using an electric mixer, beat cream cheese on medium speed for 3 minutes until smooth. Add the sugar and beat for an additional minute until well blended. Add Greek yogurt and vanilla, and beat for an additional minute, stopping partway to scrape the bottom of the bowl with a spatula. Add eggs, one at a time, beating on low speed after each addition just until blended. Do not overbeat! Pour into crust. Place the double pans in the oven on a shelf on the bottom third of the oven. Very carefully use a tea kettle (or large measuring cup) to pour the boiling water in the larger pan to form a water bath around the springform pan, so that it comes up about 1-inch around the springform. Close the oven door, and bake about 1 hour 30 min, or until center is almost set. (The cake should still jiggle ever so slightly.) Turn oven off, and open oven door slightly. Let cheesecake set in oven 1 hour. Then remove cheesecake from oven, carefully run a knife around the edges of the cake, and then let cool to room temperature. Refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight. Remove springform rim, and top cheesecake with cranberry orange topping just before serving. Store leftover cheesecake in refrigerator in a covered container.  To Make The Orange Cranberry Topping:  Bring water and sugar to boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add cranberries, cover, and cook for about 5 minutes, or until the cranberries have all just popped. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature. (I popped my berries in the freezer to speed up this process a bit.) There will be quite a bit of excess liquid. So use a slotted spoon to transfer cranberries to the top of the cheesecake, and sprinkle with the zest of one orange.","Orange Cheesecake Ingredients:  1 3/4 cups ground gingersnaps 1/3 cup unsalted butter, melted pinch of salt 1 cups sugar 3 (8-ounce) bricks PHILADELPHIA Neufchatel (Low-Fat) cream cheese, softened 1 cup Greek yogurt 2 tsp. vanilla extract, store-bought or homemade 3 eggs zest of one orange  Cranberry Orange Topping Ingredients:  4 cups (1 12-ounce bag) fresh cranberries 1 cup sugar 1 cup water (topping) zest of one orange"

Meanwhile, bring 1/2 cup of the cream to a boil in a small saucepan. When the chocolate is fully melted, move the bowl to a work surface and pour in the hot cream. Let stand for 1 minute. Stir gently until the cream is incorporated and the mixture is smooth. Let the chocolate/cream mixture stand until it is completely cool. The mixture must be at room temperature before it is added to the whipped cream. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the remaining 1 cup of heavy cream only until it holds the softest peaks. With the mixer on high speed, add the white chocolate all at once and continue to beat just until the mixture holds firm peaks. Transfer the cream to a bowl, press a piece of plastic wrap gently against the surface and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Once cooled, frost cupcakes as desired.","Mocha Cupcake Ingredients:  1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 2 cups sugar 3/4 cups cocoa powder 2 teaspoons baking soda 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 cup buttermilk, shaken 1/2 cup vegetable oil 2 eggs, at room temperature 1 tsp. pure vanilla extract 1 cup freshly brewed hot coffee 1 ½ teaspoons instant espresso granules  Frosting Ingredients:  6 oz. white chocolate, finely chopped 1 1/2 cups cold heavy cream"

main-course,Pork Tenderloin With  Burgundy Peppercorn Sauce,"To prepare the tenderloin: Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Trim pork tenderloin of any excess fat, and remove silver skin. (For a helpful video on how to remove silver skin, see here.) Heat 1 Tbsp. olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Generously season the tenderloin with the freshly-cracked black pepper, and press to be sure it sticks. Add to the skillet and cook, turning as needed, for 4 to 5 minutes (about 1 minute per side), until evenly browned. Transfer tenderloin to a greased baking dish, and place it in the oven to roast for 12 to 15 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the tenderloin reads 140 degrees. Remove dish from oven and transfer the tenderloin to a plate and cover loosely with aluminum foil to keep warm. To make the sauce: Meanwhile, in a skillet or saucepan over medium-high heat, add the shallots and sauté for 2 minutes. Then add the garlic and saute 1 more minute. Add the red wine and as it boils, deglaze the pan by scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon (helps to have one with a straight edge) to dislodge all the browned bits. Once the wine is almost cooked away, add the beef stock and turn the heat to high. Boil the sauce down until there’s a noticeable trail when you drag a wooden spoon through the center of it (4-5 minutes). Pour in the heavy cream and resume boiling. Again, boil down until you can make that telltale trail from the wooden spoon. Turn off the heat and add the parsley and any remaining black pepper (no more than 1 Tbsp, the rest should have already been used to pepper the tenderloin). Taste for salt and add if needed. Cut the tenderloin on a slight diagonal (in 1/2″ or 1″ slices), and then spoon the sauce over to serve.","1 (about 1 lb.) pork tenderloin 2 Tbsp. olive oil (separated) 1 cup finely chopped shallots or onion 3 cloves garlic, minced 1/4 cup freshly-cracked black peppercorns (preferably coarsely ground) 1/2 cup red wine 2 cups beef broth 1/2 cup heavy cream 1/2 cup parsley"

main-course,Stuffed Artichokes,"Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Fill a medium sauce pan 2/3 of the way full of water and bring to a boil. Prepare the artichoke. Cut off the stem so that the artichoke will sit flat. Cut off the top 1 to 1 1/2 inch of the artichoke, then use kitchen shears to trim the spiky tops of the outer leaves. Put the artichoke in the boiling water and cover. If your artichokes are too big, and you can’t put the lid on, place a heatproof bowl on top of them to weigh them down while they cook. Cook for 20 to 25 minutes, until you can pull away an outer leaf without too much resistance. While the artichoke is cooking, prepare the stuffing. Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the carrot and shallot (or onion). Season generously with salt and pepper; cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until soft. Add the garlic and cook for one minute more. Turn off the heat and add the thyme, zest, and breadcrumbs. Stir to combine. Taste and season again with salt and pepper. When the artichoke is finished cooking, drain the water and run the artichoke under cold water until it’s easy to handle. Put it upside-down on a kitchen towel to drain for a few minutes. Turn the artichoke over and pull out the pale leaves in the very center, about a 1-inch diameter in the middle of the artichoke. Use a teaspoon or a measuring spoon to scoop out the choke, the hairy fibers inside the middle of the artichoke. Be careful not to scoop out too much of the heart, which is the soft, tasty solid just under the choke. Running your finger around the inside of the artichoke helps find stray choke fibers. Place the artichoke in a baking dish. Spoon a tablespoon or two of stuffing into the hollow middle, then scatter the rest around the leaves, fluffing them out and making room for the stuffing to nestle in between them. Bake the stuffed artichoke for 10 to 15 minutes, until the stuffing is warm and the artichoke is very soft. To eat, pull off the leaves and scrape them along your bottom teeth, picking up stuffing as you go. Once you eat all of the leaves, cut the heart into chunks and eat with remaining stuffing on the plate.","1 medium globe artichoke 3 Tbsp. olive oil 1 medium carrot, diced 1 shallot or small onion, diced 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 tsp. fresh thyme (or 1/2 tsp. dried thyme) zest of half a lemon 1/2 cup Panko, or regular breadcrumbs salt and pepper"

Saute the onions until translucent. Then stir in the tomato paste, garlic, oregano, cinnamon, sugar, and Aleppo pepper. Turn the heat down to medium and saute for 1 minute. Add the wine and cook for 1 minute. If using fresh tomatoes, grate them on a grater over a bowl, and add the pulp with its juices to the pan. For canned tomatoes, crush them as they go into the pan. Raise the heat to medium high and cook the sauce for 8 minutes, or until thick. Taste for seasoning and remove the pan from the heat. Cover the pan. Meanwhile, once the water in the cooking pot has reached a rolling boil, add the pasta. Cook according to package instructions, until it is tender but still has a little bite. Once the pasta is done, drain it in a colander and then add it to the sauce. Toss over the heat for a minute or more to help the sauce permeate the noodles.

main-course,Stuffed Pizza Bites,"Preheat oven to temperature specified on pizza dough package. Usually it’s 400 degrees. (This is also a good option if you make your own dough.) Unroll your pizza dough onto a lightly-floured surface. Pat or roll the dough so it’s at least 12″ by 8″. Use a pizza cutter to slice the dough into 24 squares. Place cheese and desired toppings on each square. I found that it worked best if you layer the cheese on first, as this makes a softer bottom layer for the dough to fold around. Make sure to use just enough toppings so that the dough can fold easily around them. When all of your dough squares have cheese and toppings on them, carefully lift up each square and wrap the dough around the toppings. Pinch to make sure each ball is sealed shut and then place seam-side-down in a lightly sprayed pie pan (or similar sized dish). Brush the tops of the dough balls with olive oil (or melted butter) and then sprinkle with the garlic and Italian seasoning. Top with Parmesan cheese.

main-course,Zucchini Strand Linguine,"Bring a large pot of generously-salted water to a boil and add salt. Add the pasta and cook until al dente, about 10 minutes. While the water comes to a boil and the pasta cooks, cut the zucchini with a fine French-fry cutter on a mandoline. If you do not have one, cut by hand into the longest, finest julienne you can manage. Season with salt and pepper. If your zucchini is very finely cut, it does not need to be cooked. Otherwise, place in a colander, suspend over the pasta pot, cover the pot, and steam the zucchini until still slightly crunchy, about 2 minutes. Heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add the garlic and saute briefly until light brown. Turn on the exhaust fan and add the red pepper flakes. Quickly mix in the basil and parsley and remove from the heat. When the pasta is al dente, drain through a colander, reserving about 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water. Pour the pasta into a warm serving bowl; add the zucchini, basil oil, the garlic mixture, and 1/2 cup of the cheese. Toss well, adding cooking water as needed to make a smooth sauce. Taste for seasoning and add salt and pepper, as needed. Grate about 2 tablespoons Parmesan over the top and serve at once. Basil Oil (and other herb flavored oils): For soft herbs, such as basil, parsley, cilantro or tarragon: Use 4 cups packed leaves to 2 cups pure olive oil. For woody herbs, such as rosemary, sage, thyme, oregano or lemon verbena: Use 1 cup packed leaves to 2 cups pure olive oil. In a blender, puree the herbs and oil until completely smooth. Put the mixture in a saucepan and bring it to a simmer over moderate heat. Simmer for 45 seconds, then pour through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl. Don’t press on the mixture, but you can tap the strainer against your hand to get the oil to drip through faster. (The reason to save the basil oil to toss with the pasta at the end is so the oil will have a fresh, uncooked taste.)",Salt and freshly ground black pepper 3/4 pound whole-wheat dried linguine 3/4 pound zucchini 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons minced garlic 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes 3 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh basil leaves 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 1/4 cup basil oil (recipe below)

Fill a large bowl (or I used a pie pan) with warm water, and then gently dip one rice paper wrapper in the water for 3-5 seconds to soften. (Be careful not to over-soak the wrappers!) Remove, and lay on a flat surface. Now the fun begins! In a horizontal row across the center of the wrapper, first place your lettuce (this gives strength to the bottom so that the other ingredients don’t poke through), leaving at least 2″ space on the right/left sides. Then layer your rice noodles, a few beansprouts (I generally used 5-8), 3-4 shrimp halves, and cilantro on top of the lettuce. Fold the top side of the wrapper tightly over the mixture, and then fold over the right and left sides (taking care to pack in the filling so that it’s nice and snug!), and then finally roll the pack over the remaining bottom side.

dessert,Pumpkin Cupcakes With Cream Cheese Frosting,"Prep the oven and baking pan. Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a 12-cup muffin pan with baking liners, or lightly grease with cooking spray; set aside. Mix the dry ingredients. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt until combined. Mix the wet ingredients. In a separate large mixing bowl, stir together the pumpkin purée, oil, granulated sugar, brown sugar, vanilla extract and eggs until evenly combined. Combine wet and dry ingredients. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and gently stir until the mixture is just evenly combined and no dry streaks remain.  (Try to avoid over-mixing.) Bake. Portion the batter evenly into the 12 baking cups.  (I like to do this using a large 3-tablespoon cookie scoop.)  Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean.  Transfer the pan to a wire cooling rack and let the cupcakes cool completely to room temperature. Make the frosting. Meanwhile as the cupcakes bake and cool, make your frosting by combining the cream cheese, butter, 3 cups powdered sugar, vanilla extract and salt in a clean mixing bowl.  Use a rubber spatula (or you can use an electric mixer) to stir the frosting until it is completely combined and smooth.  If the frosting is too thin, continue adding in more powdered sugar until it reaches your desired consistency. Frost the cupcakes. Once the cupcakes are room temperature, use either a piping bag (I used a 1M tip) to pipe the frosting onto the cupcakes, or use a knife to spread it on generously. Feel free to sprinkle a bit of pumpkin pie spice or ground cinnamon on top of the cupcakes to finish. Serve. Then serve and enjoy!  Leftover cupcakes can be refrigerated in a sealed container for up to 3 or 4 days.","Pumpkin Cupcake Ingredients:  1 cup all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1 cup pumpkin purée 1/2 cup canola oil or vegetable oil* 1/3 cup granulated (white) sugar 1/3 cup packed light brown sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 large eggs  Cream Cheese Frosting Ingredients:  8 ounces cream cheese, room temperature 1/4 cup butter, room temperature 3 to 4 cups powdered sugar, sifted* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract pinch of fine sea salt"
dessert,Tiramisù,"Make the zabaglione. Heat 1 inch of water in a large saucepan over medium heat until simmering.  Combine the egg yolks, sugar and 1/4 cup of the dry marsala in a metal (or heat-proof glass) mixing bowl, and set it atop the saucepan.  Using a whisk (or a hand mixer on low speed), whisk the mixture constantly for 5 to 7 minutes until it has turned a pale yellow color and nearly tripled in volume.  Remove from heat and transfer the mixture to the refrigerator briefly to cool while you continue on with Steps 2 and 3. Whisk the mascarpone mixture. Combine the mascarpone, vanilla extract and sea salt in a large mixing bowl.  Use a hand mixer (or a stand mixer) to beat the mixture on medium speed for 1 minute or until smooth.  Transfer mascarpone mixture to a clean bowl and set aside. Whip the cream. Add the heavy cream to the same large mixing bowl and beat using a handheld mixer (or stand mixer) on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form. Combine the filling.  Use a rubber spatula to gently fold the mascarpone mixture into the whipped cream until it is mostly combined.  Then gradually fold in the zabaglione mixture until combined.  Set aside. Make the espresso mixture. Stir together the espresso and remaining 1/4 cup of marsala in a small bowl. Assemble the tiramisu. One at a time, dip the ladyfingers (very quickly!) into the espresso so that both sides are coated, then arrange the lady fingers in an even layer covering the bottom of a 9×13-inch baking dish.  Once the layer is complete, use a spoon (or an offset spatula) to spread half of the creamy filling mixture evenly on top of the ladyfingers.  Repeat with a second layer of the espresso-dipped ladyfingers, followed by a second layer of the creamy filling. Chill. Cover and refrigerate the tiramisù for at least 4 to 6 hours, or until chilled. Serve. Use a fine-mesh strainer to dust the top of the tiramisù evenly with a layer of cocoa powder.  Then slice, serve and enjoy!  Leftovers can be covered and refrigerated for up to 3 days.","8 large egg yolks 2/3 cup granulated sugar 1/2 cup dry marsala*, divided 1 pound (16 ounces) mascarpone cheese 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 1 1/2 cups espresso (or very strong coffee*) 36 to 42 crisp Italian ladyfingers (one 14-ounce package*) unsweetened cocoa powder"
dessert,Sopapillas,"Make the dough. Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a large mixing bowl until combined.  Use a pastry cutter or a fork to briefly cut the coconut oil into the dry ingredients mixture until combined.  Gradually add in the warm water and stir the mixture with a spatula or wooden spoon until a rough dough begins to form. Knead and rest the dough. Using your hands, knead the dough in the mixing bowl for 2 minutes or until the dough is smooth, sprinkling on some extra flour if needed to prevent the dough from sticking.  Form the dough into a ball.  Then cover the mixing bowl with a damp towel or plastic wrap, and let the dough rest for 20 minutes. Roll out the dough. When the dough is ready, turn it out onto a floured surface.  (At this point, go ahead and begin heating your oil, as directed in Step 4.)  Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out evenly until it is about 1/4-inch thick.  Then use a pizza slicer, pastry cutter or a knife to cut the the dough into 2 to 3-inch squares (or whatever shapes you prefer). Heat the oil. Meanwhile, just before you begin rolling out the dough, fill a large saucepan with 1.5 to 2 inches of oil.  Heat over medium-high heat until the oil reaches 375°F, then reduce heat to medium (or whatever temperature is needed) to maintain that temperature, more or less. Fry the dough. Once the oil is hot, very carefully lay a dough square in the hot oil.  It will sink for a moment then rise to the surface and will likely immediately bubble up.  (If it doesn’t, just add a spoonful or two of hot oil on top of the dough, and it should bubble up within a few seconds.)  Fry for 30-60 seconds, or until the bottom of the dough is lightly golden.  Flip and cook on the other side until lightly golden.  Then carefully transfer the sopapilla to a paper-towel-lined baking sheet.  Repeat with the remaining dough squares.  (I typically fry a batch of 3 at a time.) Sprinkle.  Sprinkle the cooked sopapillas with powdered sugar or cinnamon sugar.  (Or you can dip them in powdered sugar or cinnamon sugar.) Serve. Serve warm with honey and enjoy!","2 cups all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon fine sea salt 2 tablespoons coconut oil (or butter), room temperature 3/4 cup warm water oil, for frying (see notes below) powdered sugar or cinnamon sugar, for topping honey, for serving"

dessert,How To Freeze Cookie Dough,"To Freeze Unbaked Cookie Dough Balls:  Form the dough balls.  Use a cookie scoop or a spoon to form the correct size/shape of dough balls for your recipe. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet.  Line a baking sheet (whichever size will fit in your freezer) with parchment paper.  Place the dough balls in a single layer on the baking sheet. Freeze.  Transfer the entire baking sheet to the freezer and freeze for 3-4 hours, or until the dough balls are frozen. Transfer to storage bag/container.  Remove the baking sheet from the freezer and transfer the dough balls to a storage bag (either a ziplock or a reusable storage bag) or a food storage container (such as these).  Freeze for up to 3 months.  To Freeze Unbaked Cookie Dough Cut-Outs:  Form the dough discs.  Shape the dough with your hands into a flat 1-inch-thick disc.  Or if you your recipe calls for the dough to be shaped into a log, shape the doug into whatever size/shape of log is required. Wrap tightly.  Tightly wrap the dough with plastic wrap or reusable beeswrap, making sure that every part of the surface is covered to prevent freezer burn. Freeze.  Freeze for up to 3 months.  Once you are ready to use the dough, transfer the wrapped dough to the refrigerator and let it thaw for 24-48 hours until it is soft enough to roll/slice.  To Freeze Unbaked Cookie Dough Discs:  Cut out the cookie dough.  Cut out the cookie dough shapes (using cookie cutters, biscuit cutters, etc.) according to your recipe instructions. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet.  Line a baking sheet (whichever size will fit in your freezer) with parchment paper.  Place the dough cut-outs in a single layer (not overlapping) on the baking sheet. Freeze.  Transfer the entire baking sheet to the freezer, and freeze for 3-4 hours, or until the dough is frozen.

dessert,Pecan Pie (No Corn Syrup!),"Heat oven.  Heat oven to 400°F. Blind bake the pie crust. Chill the unbaked pie crust for at least 20 minutes in the refrigerator or freezer.  Use parchment paper to line the inside of the chilled crust, shaping it gently around the inner edges to form a mold of the crust. Fill the bottom of the crust with pie weights or dried beans.  Bake for 15 minutes. Remove the pie pan from the oven, carefully lift out the parchment and weights, and set them aside.  Decrease the oven heat to 350°F. Prepare the maple sauce: Meanwhile, whisk three eggs, maple syrup, coconut sugar (or brown sugar), bourbon, cornstarch, vanilla, sea salt and ground cinnamon together in a large bowl until combined.  Add the melted butter and quickly whisk in until combined. Make the egg wash.  In a separate small bowl, whisk together the remaining one egg and an extra tablespoon or milk (or water) until combined.  Brush the egg wash lightly over the edges of the pie crust, which will help it to bake up nice and golden. Assemble the pie. Arrange the pecans in an even layer in the pie crust.  Pour the maple sauce evenly over the top of the pecans. Bake.  Bake the pie for 40-50 minutes, or until the top is lightly browned. After the first 20 to 25 minutes of bake time, you are welcome to loosely tent a piece of aluminum foil over the top of the whole pie if the crust or pecans seem to be browning too quickly.  The pie will be ready to go once the top is puffed up into a dome (which will sink to become flat again, once the pie has set and cooled).  Transfer the pie to a wire rack and let it rest until it reaches room temperature. Serve. Slice and serve pie at room temperature (or you can refrigerate and chill the pie, if you prefer).  Cover and store leftover pie at room temperature for 1-2 days or in the refrigerator for 4-5 days.","1 (9-inch) unbaked pie crust, homemade or store-bought 4 large eggs, room temperature, divided 1 cup pure maple syrup 1/2 cup packed coconut sugar (or packed brown sugar) 2 tablespoons bourbon* 2 teaspoons cornstarch (or 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour) 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 teaspoon fine sea salt 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted 2 1/2 cups (one 10-ounce bag) pecan halves"
dessert,The Best Pumpkin Pie,"Heat oven.  Preheat oven to 350°F. Make the pie crust.  Prepare an (unbaked) 9-inch pie crust according to recipe/package instructions.  (I recommend chilling the crust in the fridge for at least 15 minutes before adding the filling, so that it is nice and firm and will hold its shape while baking.) Make the filling.  In a large mixing bowl, whisk the pumpkin purée, three of the eggs, maple syrup, milk, cornstarch, pumpkin pie spice, vanilla extract and salt together until well combined. Make the egg wash.  In a separate small bowl, whisk together the remaining one egg and an extra tablespoon or milk (or water) until combined.  Brush the egg wash lightly over the edges of the pie crust, which will help it to bake up nice and golden. Combine.  Pour the filling into the prepared pie crust and smooth out the top so that it is nice and flat. Bake.  Bake for 50-55 minutes, or until the center of the pie filling is ever-so-slightly jiggly.  (If you insert a toothpick in the outer edges of the pie filling, it should come out clean.)  Transfer the pie to a wire baking rack and let it cool until it reaches room temperature.  Then transfer to the fridge for 2-3 hours until it is completely chilled.

dessert,Homemade Pie Crust,"Mix the dry ingredients: Combine the flour, sugar (optional) and salt in a large mixing bowl or a food processor.  Whisk or pulse briefly until combined. Cut the butter into the dry ingredients: Sprinkle the diced butter evenly over the dry ingredient mixture.  If working by hand, use a pastry cutter or two forks to cut the butter into the dry ingredients until the butter is evenly dispersed into pea-sized (or smaller) bits.  If using a food processor, briefly pulse the butter and dry ingredients together 5 to 7 times until the butter is evenly dispersed into pea-sized (or smaller) bits, then transfer the mixture to a large mixing bowl. Add water: Sprinkle the dough evenly with the ice water. Use a spatula to quickly mix the water into the dough until it is evenly combined, and the dough begins to form moist clumps.  (If the dough is not sticking together, you can add 1 or 2 more tablespoons of water to help it clump.)  Try not to overmix the dough. Form a dough ball: Using your hands, quickly pack the dough into a ball (like you’re packing a snowball).  Then flatten the ball into a 3/4-inch thick disk. Wrap and chill the dough: Wrap the dough disk tightly in plastic wrap, then refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to 3 days, until ready to roll out and use.","1 1/4 cups (150 grams) all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons granulated sugar (optional) 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup (115 grams) cold unsalted butter*, diced into 1/4-inch cubes 1/4 cup ice water"

Roll the panellets. Roll the marzipan dough into 1-inch balls (for the pine nut version) or 1-inch little logs (for the almond version), about 20 grams each.  Whisk one egg in a small bowl, and place the pine nuts or almonds in a second bowl.  Dip a dough ball into the egg mixture until it is completely coated.  Then transfer the dough ball to the bowl of nuts, and use your hands to gently press the nuts so that the entire ball is covered.  (This takes some patience and will require you to get your hands dirty, so plan for this step to take some time.) Prepare the oven.  Heat the oven to 425°F. Brush the panellets.  Place the rolled panellets onto a large parchment-covered baking sheet.  Whisk the final egg plus 1 tablespoon of water together in a small bowl.  Then brush each of the panellets with the egg wash. Bake. Bake for 10 minutes, or until the tops of the panellets are lightly golden.  (Be sure to keep a close eye on them so that the nuts do not burn.)

dessert,5-Ingredient Lemon Bars,"Preheat oven to 350°F.  Line an 8 x 8-inch baking pan with parchment paper; set aside. Combine all of the crust ingredients in a food processor.  Pulse until the mixture reaches a fine crumble consistency.  You want the butter to be well combined, but to stop before the mixture turns into a ball.  (Alternately, you can combine the crust ingredients together in a mixing bowl with a pastry cutter or a fork.) Sprinkle the crust mixture evenly into the prepared pan.  Then press the mixture down firmly to form an even layer. Bake the crust for 20 minutes, or until it is lightly golden on top. Meanwhile, whisk the lemon filling ingredients together in a medium mixing bowl until combined.  If your powdered sugar or flour are too chunky or there are lots of bubbles whisked into the filling, feel free to just pour the filling through a fine-mesh strainer to get it nice and smooth before adding it to the crust.  (But if there are a few little clumps, that’s ok too!)

dessert,Maple Candied Pecans,"Combine all ingredients in a sauté pan, and toss with a spoon or spatula until the pecans are evenly coated and the spices have mostly dissolved into the maple syrup. Cook the mixture on medium heat until the maple syrup comes to a low simmer, stirring occasionally.  (We’re looking for small, gentle bubbles here — not a vigorous boil.) Reduce heat to medium-low (or whatever temperature works on your stovetop to maintain a low simmer).  Continue simmering the mixture for about 20-25 minutes — stirring often — until the liquid in the maple syrup has evaporated and its sugars have crystalized.  The maple syrup will go through the following stages: (1) Thin and liquidy: It will simmer and bubble easily, and the pecans will be lightly coated.  Stir every 1-2 minutes or so. (2) Thick and syrupy: The bubbles will start to get thicker and slower, and the pecans will start to stick together more. (3) Crystalized and grainy: Once the maple syrup has almost completely evaporated (there may still be some tiny bubbles on the bottom of your pan), you’ll notice that it starts to crystalize and look like microscopic little grains of sugar on the pecans.  This is good — it means that they’re nearly ready to go!  Once you notice that the maple syrup has just begun to crystalize, go ahead and cook the pecans for 1 more minute.  Stir often, every 20 seconds or so. Immediately pour the candied pecans out onto a flat surface (like a cookie sheet) covered with parchment paper.  Use your spatula to break apart the clumps and spread the pecans out in an even layer. (You can also do this with your fingers, once the pecans have cooled a bit).  Then let them cool completely until they reach room temperature.

In a large mixing bowl either with a stand mixer (with the blade attachment) or hand mixer, beat the butter and sugar together on medium-speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.  Add the egg, vanilla and almond extract.  Beat on medium speed until completely combined, scraping down the sides partway through if needed.  Add in the dry ingredients, and beat on low speed until just combined.  (You don’t want to over-beat this dough.) Form the dough into a ball, and place it on a large, lightly-floured hard surface.  Use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough evenly until it is approximately 1/4-inch thick.  Then use your favorite cookie cutters to cut out your desired shapes, re-rolling the dough as needed to cut out more.  Transfer the cookies to a parchment-covered baking sheet. Place the baking sheet in the freezer for about 5-10 minutes to chill the dough. Once the dough is nice and firm, transfer the baking sheet to the oven.  Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges just barely begin to turn golden.  Remove from heat and let the cookie rest on the tray for 5 minutes.  Then transfer them to a wire baking rack to cool completely. Enjoy the cookies immediately, or store in a sealed container for up to 1 week or freeze for up to 3 months.  To Make The Icing:  Whisk all ingredients together until combined.  If the icing is too thin, add more powdered sugar until it reaches your desired consistency.  If it is too thick, add a touch more milk. Use immediately, or refrigerate in a sealed container.  (The icing sets up as it sits, so you will need to give it a good whisk and maybe pop it in the microwave for a few seconds to loosen it back up after being refrigerated.)","Brown Sugar Cookie Ingredients:  1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for rolling 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened 1/2 cup packed brown sugar 1 egg 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon almond extract  Quick Icing Ingredients:  1 cup sifted powdered sugar 2–3 teaspoons milk (any kind) 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract"

dessert,Peanut Butter Flourless Chocolate Cake,"To Make The Peanut Butter Flourless Chocolate Cake:  Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and heat the oven to 325°F. Line the bottom of an 8-inch springform pan with parchment paper or waxed paper and grease the sides of the pan. (Be sure to grease the sides really well!) Place a large roasting or baking pan on the bottom rack of the oven.  Bring a kettle or medium-sized pot of water to boil on the stove.  Once it comes to a boil, carefully pour the water into the baking pan in the oven.  This will be your water bath, and will help prevent the top of the cake from cracking. While the water is coming to a boil, add the eggs to the bowl of a stand mixer.  Using the whisk attachment, beat the eggs at high speed until the volume doubles. This usually takes about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, melt the chocolate and butter and peanut butter together. You can either do this in a double boiler on the stove (by placing the chocolate and butter and peanut butter in a large heatproof bowl, set over a pan of almost-simmering water, and stirring until melted and smooth). Or you can do this in the microwave (by heating the chocolate and butter and peanut butter in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until the ingredients are melted and smooth). Then fold about a third of the beaten eggs into the chocolate mixture using a large rubber spatula until only a few streaks of egg are visible. Fold in half of the remaining egg foam, and then the last half of the foam, until the mixture is totally homogenous. Scrape the batter into the prepared springform pan and smooth the surface with a rubber spatula. Place the springform pan on the middle rack of the oven (a rack above the pan of boiling water). Bake until the cake has risen slightly, the edges are just beginning to set, a thin-glazed crust (like a brownie) has formed on the surface, and an instant-read thermometer inserted halfway into the center reads 140° F, about 23-26 minutes. Turn the oven off and crack the door oven open a few inches, and wait about 10 minutes for the cake to slightly cool.  Then remove cake and transfer to a wire rack, and cool until it reaches room temperature.  Then cover and refrigerate until the cake is completely chilled. (The cake can be refrigerated for up to 4 days.) Once the cake has chilled, carefully remove the sides of the springform pan, invert the cake onto a sheet of waxed paper, peel off the parchment paper, and then re-invert the cake onto a serving platter. Top with the peanut butter chocolate ganache swirl, if desired.  Or you can serve the cake lightly dusted with powdered sugar, or just plain.  To Make The Peanut Butter Chocolate Ganache Swirl:  Melt the chocolate and heavy cream together in a double-boiler or in the microwave (use the same directions as above), and whisk together until the mixture is completely smooth. Add the peanut butter to a separate bowl, and heat in the microwave (about 15-25 seconds) until it is warmed and a little melty.  Transfer the peanut butter to a pastry bag or a large ziplock bag, and then use scissors to snip off a small corner of the bag so that you can pipe the peanut butter.  Set aside. Pour the chocolate mixture on top of the chilled cake, and use a spoon to spread it out in an even layer.  Pipe the melted peanut butter on top of the chocolate in some long lines (or your desired pattern).  Then immediately take a wooden skewer (or a toothpick or a knife) and drag it through the peanut butter in circles to create swirls.  If you’d like, you can then run a knife around the edge of the cake to smooth out the sides, or you can just leave it drippy. Refrigerate the cake for about an hour to let the ganache firm up, or you can just serve it immediately.","Peanut Butter Flourless Chocolate Cake Ingredients:   8 large eggs, cold 1 pound (16 ounces) dark, semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter   Peanut Butter Chocolate Ganache Swirl Ingredients:  3 ounces dark, semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped 1/3 cup heavy cream 1/3 cup creamy peanut butter"

Very carefully use a tea kettle (or large measuring cup) to pour the boiling water in the larger pan to form a water bath around the springform, so that it comes up about 1-inch around the springform. Close the oven door, and bake about 1 hour 15 min, or until center is almost set. (The cake should still jiggle ever so slightly.) Turn oven off, and open oven door slightly. Let cheesecake set in oven about 1 hour. Then remove cheesecake from oven, carefully run a knife around the edges of the cake, and then let cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight. Remove springform rim, and top cheesecake with desired toppings. Serve, or cover and refrigerate for up to 5 days.  TO MAKE THE TOPPING:  Spread about 2/3 of the chocolate ganache evenly over the top of the cheesecake, once it has been chilled.  Sprinkle evenly with almonds, chocolate chips and toasted coconut. Add the remaining 1/3 of the chocolate ganache to a piping bag or Ziplock bag (with a tiny bottom corner snipped off), then drizzle it over the top of the cheesecake.  Or, you can also just drizzle it with a fork.  TO MAKE THE CHOCOLATE GANACHE:  Combine all ingredients in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the chocolate is completely melted.  Remove from heat and let cool for at least 5 minutes before drizzling.  The ganache will thicken as it cools.","CHEESECAKE INGREDIENTS:  2 cups almond meal** 6 Tablespoons (1/3 cup) melted butter 3 (8-ounce) bricks neufchatel (low-fat) cream cheese, softened 1 cup granulated sugar 1 cup plain or vanilla Greek yogurt 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 teaspoon almond extract 3 eggs  SAMOA TOPPING INGREDIENTS:  chocolate ganache (see ingredients below) 1/2 cup Blue Diamond almonds (I used Blue Diamond Roasted Salted Almonds) 1/2 cup semisweet or dark chocolate chips 1/2 cup toasted flaked or shredded coconut  CHOCOLATE GANACHE INGREDIENTS:  6 ounces semisweet or dark chocolate (I used chocolate chips) 1/4 cup almond or 2% dairy milk (I used Blue Diamond Almond Breeze Original Almond Milk) 2 tablespoons butter or coconut oil"

Meanwhile, scrape the black seeds out of the vanilla bean and place in a medium saucepan with heavy cream, and stir to combine  Heat over medium heat until simmering, but not boiling, stirring occasionally.  Remove from heat and let the mixture rest for 5 minutes. Meanwhile in a separate bowl, use a hand mixer to blend your egg yolks, ¾ cup sugar and salt for about 1 minute on medium speed until light and smooth.  Add about 1/4 cup of the cream mixture to the eggs, whisking immediately to combine and temper the eggs.  Repeat.  Then add the remaining cream mixture, whisking while combining so as not to cook the eggs. Strain the custard through a fine mesh strainer to remove vanilla beans and any bits of egg that may have cooked.  Then portion the remaining custard into the ramekins so that they are each nearly full. Place the baking dish full of ramekins in the oven, then pour the boiling kettle full of water in the pan (careful to avoid the inside of the ramekins) until the water reaches 2/3 of the way up the sides of the ramekins.  Bake for about 45-50 minutes, or until the edges of the custard in the ramekins are set, and the centers are only very slightly jiggly.  Carefully remove pan from oven.  Then use a spatula or tongs to carefully transfer ramekins to a cooling rack.  Let the custards come to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 3 hours until cool. When ready to serve, sprinkle the tops each custard evenly with 1-2 teaspoons of sugar.  (Superfine sugar is preferable, but granulated sugar will work.)  Use a kitchen torch to caramelize the top of each custard, holding the torch 2-3 inches from the top of the custard and slowly moving the flame back and forth across the surface until it is a deep amber color and bubbly.  Let the custard rest for at least one minute.  Then serve, topped with fresh berries that have been rolled in sugar, if desired.","1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise (or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, store-bought or homemade) 4 cups heavy cream 1 cup sugar, divided 8 large egg yolks pinch of salt sugar-coated fresh berries, for garnish"

dessert,Rum Cake (From Scratch!),"How To Make The Cake:  Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a bundt pan liberally with cooking spray.  Then add a few tablespoons of granulated sugar to the inside of the pan, and gently tap and turn it around until every square inch of the inside of the pan is coated in sugar.  (Be especially sure that the inner cone of the bundt pan is coated in sugar so that the cake does not stick.)  Set aside. In a large bowl, whisk together cake flour (*or see substitute below), baking powder, salt, baking soda, and 1 1/2 cups sugar until combined.  In a different medium bowl or large measuring cup, whisk together melted butter, buttermilk, rum, oil, vanilla, and yolks until combined.  Set aside. In clean bowl of a stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, beat egg whites at medium-high speed until foamy, about 30-45 seconds.  With whisk still running, add in the remaining 1/4 cup sugar.  Continue to beat until stiff peaks just form, about 60-90 more seconds. Transfer the whipped egg whites to a separate bowl and set aside. Add the flour mixture to now-empty mixing bowl. Using the whisk attachment again, gradually pour in butter mixture and mix on medium-low speed until it is just combined, about 15 seconds. (Don’t overmix!)  Stop the mixer and scrape whisk and sides of bowl. Return mixer to medium-low speed and beat until the mixture is smooth and fully incorporated, about 10 to 15 more seconds.  Fold about 1/3 of the whipped egg whites into batter until just combined, then add the remaining whites and gently fold in until no streaks remain. Pour the batter evenly into the sugared bundt pan.  Bake for 40-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean.  (Don’t overbake!)  Transfer the cake to a cooling rack and let it cool for at least 15 minutes.  (While the cake cools — or even better, while it’s in the oven — make the butter-rum sauce.  Instructions below.) Once the cake is slightly cool, use a toothpick or skewer to poke lots of holes all over the surface of the cake (while it is still in the pan.)  Pour about half of the butter rum sauce over the surface of the cake.  Let it rest for 5-10 minutes until the sauce is absorbed.  Then carefully invert the cake onto a serving platter or pedestal, and drizzle the remaining sauce evenly on top of the cake. Serve immediately, or cover until ready to serve.

Once the pan reaches room temperature, carefully wrap the outside of the pan in 2 layers of heavy-duty aluminum foil, being sure that there are NO gaps where water could seep through. Place the pan in a large roasting dish (or any pan larger than the springform), and bring a tea kettle or pot of water to boil in preparation for the water bath. Set aside. Using an electric mixer, beat cream cheese on medium speed for 3 minutes until smooth. Add the remaining 1 cup sugar and beat for an additional minute until well blended.

dessert,Lemon Meringue Pie,"To Make The Filling:  Whisk the sugar, cornstarch, salt and water in a large (nonreactive) saucepan. Heat over medium heat until the mixture thickens and reaches a simmer, stirring fairly often. When the mixture starts to simmer and turns translucent, whisk in the egg yolks, one at a time. Then whisk in the zest, then the lemon juice, and then the butter. Bring the mixture to a good simmer, whisking constantly. Remove from the heat. Place a sheet of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the filling to keep it hot and prevent a skin from forming. To Make The Meringue: In a small saucepan, whisk together the cornstarch and water until combined. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat, whisking occasionally at the beginning and more frequently as the mixture thickens. Once the mixture starts to simmer and turns translucent, remove from heat and set aside. Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 325 degrees. In a small bowl, whisk the cream of tartar and sugar together. In the bowl of a large stand mixer, beat the egg whites and vanilla for 1-2 minutes on medium-high speed until frothy. Beat in the sugar mixture, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the sugar is completely incorporated. Continue beating on medium speed until the mixture forms soft peaks. (*Look ahead to multitask the next step with the lemon filling at this point.) Add the cornstarch mixture, 1 tablespoon at a time, while the mixture is still beating. Continue to beat on medium speed until the mixture forms stiff peaks, about 1-2 minutes. *When you are about a minute away from finishing the meringue, remove the plastic from the lemon filling and return the saucepan to medium heat. Let it heat for at least 1 minute so that it is nice and hot when you add it to the pie shell. Once your meringue is ready and the filling is hot, pour the filling into the prebaked pie shell and use a rubber spatula to even out the top. Use a spoon to immediately add small spoonfuls of the meringue all around the edge of the filling, and then add spoonfuls to the center until the entire surface of the filling is covered. Make sure the meringue attaches to the piecrust to prevent shrinking. Use the back of a spoon to create little decorative peaks all over the meringue, or whatever design you would like. Bake the pie until the meringue is lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and cool to room temperature. Serve the same day. *Be sure that the eggs you use to make the meringue are fresh.

dessert,Samoa Cheesecake,"To Make The Cheesecake:  Preheat oven to 325°F, and grease a 9-inch springform pan. Carefully wrap the outside of the pan in 2 layers of heavy-duty aluminum foil, being sure that there are NO gaps where water could seep through. Add Oreo cookies to the bowl of a food processor, and process until completely crumbled. (Or you can do this step by hand by crushing Oreos with a meat mallet inside a ziplock freezer bag.) Add in the melted butter, and stir or process until evenly mixed with the Oreos. Press the Oreo mixture evenly into the bottom of the springform pan. Then place the pan in a large roasting dish (or any pan larger than the springform), and bring a tea kettle or pot of water to boil in preparation for the water bath. Set aside.  (*If you don’t want to place the pan directly in a water bath, you can skip this last step and just place a pan of water on the shelf beneath the cheesecake pan.) Using an electric mixer, beat cream cheese on medium speed for 3 minutes until smooth. Add sugar and beat for an additional minute until well blended. Add Greek yogurt and vanilla, and beat for an additional minute, stopping partway to scrape the bottom of the bowl with a spatula. Add eggs, one at a time, beating on low speed after each addition just until blended. Do not overbeat! Pour into crust. Place the double pans in the oven on a shelf on the bottom third of the oven. Very carefully use a tea kettle (or large measuring cup) to pour the boiling water in the larger pan to form a water bath around the springform, so that it comes up about 1-inch around the springform. Close the oven door, and bake about 1 hour 30 min, or until center is almost set. (The cake should still jiggle ever so slightly.) Turn oven off, and open oven door slightly. Let cheesecake set in oven 1 hour. Then remove cheesecake from oven, carefully run a knife around the edges of the cake, and then let cool to room temperature. Refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight. Remove springform rim, and top cheesecake with Samoa topping. Return the cheesecake to the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes for the topping to set. Then serve, or cover and refrigerate for up to 5 days.  To Make The Topping:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spread shredded coconut out in an even layer on a parchment-covered (or aluminum foil-covered) baking sheet. Bake for about 6 minutes, or until the top layer of coconut is toasted and lightly golden, then remove the tray and stir the coconut. Bake for an additional 3-4 minutes or until the new layer of coconut is lightly golden. (Keep a close eye on it so that the coconut does not burn.) Remove the pan, and pour coconut into a mixing bowl. Add 1 cup caramel sauce to the bowl with the coconut, and stir to combine. (If your caramel is not very pour-able, heat it in the microwave or in a small saucepan until it is just slightly warmed.) Using a spoon, spread a separate 1/2 cup of caramel sauce onto the chilled cheesecake. Then top with the caramel/coconut mixture, and press it down until the top of the cheesecake is covered. Pour the melted chocolate into a piping bag or a Ziplock bag with the corner snipped off, then pipe it onto the top of the coconut/caramel mixture in even lines. Repeat in a separate bag with the remaining caramel sauce.","Cheesecake Ingredients:  24 Oreo cookies 4 Tablespoons melted butter pinch of salt 3 (8-ounce) bricks neufchatel (low-fat) cream cheese, softened 1 cup granulated sugar 1 cup plain or vanilla Greek yogurt 2 tsp. vanilla extract, store-bought or homemade 3 eggs  Samoa Topping Ingredients:  2 cups shredded sweetened coconut 1 3/4 cups caramel dip or sauce (you can either buy the 16-ounce store-bought tubs of caramel dip, or use 1 3/4 cups homemade caramel sauce) 4 ounces dark chocolate"
dessert,Mojito Pie,"To Make The Graham Cracker Crust:  Preheat oven to 350°F. Stir together graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and butter in a bowl until evenly combined. Press mixture evenly onto bottom and up side of a 9-inch (4-cup) pie plate. Bake crust on the middle oven shelf for 10 minutes, then remove and let cool.  To Make The Filling:  While the crust is baking, make your filling. Combine mint leaves and lime juice in a shaker or glass. Use a muddler (or the end of a large wooden spoon) to muddle the mint into the lime juice. Then strain out the juice and discard the mint leaves. In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the condensed milk and egg yolks in a bowl until combined. Add the minty lime juice and rum (if using) and whisk by hand for 1 minute until combined and slightly thickened. Pour filling into crust and bake on the middle oven shelf for 15 minutes. Transfer pie to a cooling rack, and let sit until it reaches room temperature. Then refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or until chilled and set.

dessert,Strawberry Shortcake with Coconut Whipped Cream (Vegan),,
dessert,Coconut Whipped Cream,"First, place your mixing bowl and beater in the freezer for 5-10 minutes to chill. When you are ready to make the coconut whipped cream, remove the mixing bowl from the freezer. Then carefully remove the can of coconut milk from the refrigerator without shaking or tipping it. Remove the top of the can, then use a spoon to carefully spoon out the thick layer of coconut cream that should have separated to the top of the can, and transfer it to your chilled mixing bowl. (You will not use the layer of coconut water that has settled to the bottom of the can.) Using a whisk attachment, beat the coconut cream on medium speed for 2-4 minutes, or until the cream becomes light and fluffy and small peaks form. Add in your sugar (or other sweetener) and vanilla extract, and beat until incorporated. Serve the coconut whipped cream immediately, or transfer to a sealed container and refrigerate until ready to use. If the whipped cream becomes too firm in the refrigerator, you can re-whip it to reach the desired consistency. *The level of sweetness in this recipe is totally up to you, and different brands of coconut milk have varying levels of sweetness, so I recommend adding sweetener to taste. I prefer to use powdered sugar, but you can also use granulated sugar, honey, agave or other sweeteners. The texture of different sweeteners may affect the consistency of the coconut whipped cream.","1 (14 ounce) can full-fat coconut milk, refrigerated for 24 hours 1–3 tablespoons powdered sugar (add to taste, also see other sweetener options below) 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, store-bought or homemade"
dessert,3-Ingredient Nutella Croissants,"Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper or misting with cooking spray. Sprinkle a cutting board or other flat surface lightly with flour. Then spread out the puff pastry sheet so that it is flat. Use a rolling pin to roll out the puff pastry until it is smooth and even. Use a pizza cutter or knife to then cut the puff pastry along the three folding lines into thirds. Then cut each long rectangle into two long triangles, making six triangles total. Place a dallop (about 1 tablespoon) of Nutella on the wide end of the triangle, and use a spoon to spread it out just a bit over the triangle. (Try to leave at least a 1/2-inch border all the way around the edges of the triangle, though, so the Nutella does not seep out during baking.) Then, beginning with the wide end of the triangle, roll the dough up into a croissant shape. Place on a baking sheet, and turn in the edges of the dough slightly to make a “U” croissant shape. Repeat with the remaining five triangles. Then repeat with the second sheet of puff pastry and remaining Nutella. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg and one tablespoon of water until combined. Then liberally brush the egg mixture onto the top of each croissant. (You can also use the egg wash to help seal the ends of the croissant, if they are not holding together.) Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the croissants are golden and flaky. Serve immediately or store in a sealed container for up to 3 days.","1 package (2 sheets) store-bought puff pastry*, thawed but still cool 3/4 cup Nutella 1 egg (plus 1 tablespoon of water)"

dessert,3-Ingredient Flourless Chocolate Cake,"Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and heat the oven to 325°F. Line the bottom of an 8-inch springform pan with parchment paper or waxed paper and grease the sides of the pan. (Be sure to grease the sides really well!) Wrap the outside of the pan with 2 sheets of heavy-duty aluminum foil and set it in a large roasting pan, or any pan that’s larger than the springform. Bring a kettle or pot of water to boil. In a stand mixer using the whisk attachment, beat the eggs at high speed until the volume doubles. This usually takes about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, melt the chocolate and butter together. You can either do this in a double boiler on the stove (by placing the chocolate and butter in a large heatproof bowl, set over a pan of almost-simmering water, and stirring until melted and smooth). Or you can do this in the microwave (by heating the chocolate and butter in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until the chocolate and butter are melted and smooth). Then fold about a third of the beaten eggs into the chocolate mixture using a large rubber spatula until only a few streaks of egg are visible. Fold in half of the remaining egg foam, and then the last half of the foam, until the mixture is totally homogenous. Scrape the batter into the prepared springform pan and smooth the surface with a rubber spatula. Place the roasting pan on the oven rack and VERY carefully pour in enough boiling water to come about halfway up the sides of the springform pan. Bake until the cake has risen slightly, the edges are just beginning to set, a thin-glazed crust (like a brownie) has formed on the surface, and an instant-read thermometer inserted halfway into the center reads 140° F, 22-25 minutes. Remove the springform pan from the water bath and set on a wire rack; cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate until cool. (The cake can be refrigerated for up to 4 days.) About 30 minutes prior to serving, carefully remove the sides of the springform pan, invert the cake onto a sheet of waxed paper, peel off the parchment paper, and reinvert the cake onto a serving platter. If desired, lightly dust the cake with powdered sugar and top with berries. To slice, use a sharp, thin-bladed knife, dipping the knife into a pitcher of hot water and wiping the blade before each cut.","8 large eggs, cold 1 lb. dark, semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped 16 Tbsp.

dessert,Almond Joy Energy Bites,"Add dates and remaining ingredients to a food processor. Pulse a few times to combine, then use a rubber spatula to scrape the sides of the bowl. Blend the mixture for about 3 minutes, or until the mixture has moved past the crumbly stage and begins to clump and stick to the sides of the food processor. Use a spoon or small cookie scoop to measure out a tablespoon of dough (or your desired size) and roll it into a ball. If desired, roll the ball in a bowl of coconut flakes. Or just set it aside to eat as-is. Repeat with the remaining dough. (Alternately, you can flatten the dough into the bottom of an 8×8-inch parchment-lined baking dish, then cut it into bars.) Store the energy bites in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks. **I used Medjool dates in this recipe, which are already nice and soft.

Serve topped with berries, lemon zest, other desired toppings, or plain. **Note about the Greek yogurt: It is VERY important that your Greek yogurt is thick for this recipe. If it is too thin, the cheesecake will not set up and will have more of a pudding consistency. I used Fage Total 2% Greek yogurt for mine, and it worked perfectly. But if your Greek yogurt is not thick — for example, if you poke a spoon in it vertically and it falls over — just strain it through a cheesecloth to remove the excess water. Then measure out 1 cup with the Greek yogurt that has been strained.

In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves (optional), and salt until combined. Then in a separate bowl, stir together pumpkin, buttermilk and vanilla until combined. Using an electric mixer, beat butter and granulated sugar on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add eggs and beat 1 minute, using a rubber spatula to scrape the bottom of the bowl so that everything is combined. Reduce speed to low and add flour and pumpkin mixtures alternately in batches, beginning and ending with flour mixture and mixing until batter is just smooth. Do not overbeat. Transfer batter into pan, and smooth the top of the batter with a spatula so that it is smooth. Bake until a wooden pick or skewer inserted in center of cake comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool cake in pan on a cooking rack for at least 20 minutes. Then invert cake onto a cooling rack or a cake platter. Top with cream cheese glaze when cooled, or dust with powdered sugar.  To Make The Cream Cheese Glaze:  Using an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese, vanilla, and powdered sugar together on medium low speed until combined.

dessert,S’mores Bars,"To Make The Brownies:  Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 325°F. Line the bottom and sides of a 9×13-inch baking pan with parchment paper. Lightly grease with cooking spray. Then line the bottom of the pan with tightly-packed graham crackers in a single layer. Set aside. Combine the butter, sugar, cocoa, and salt in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for one minute intervals, stirring in between, until the butter is melted and the mixture is smooth. Set the mixture aside until it cools to room temperature. (You can pop it in the fridge to speed up this process.) Stir in the vanilla. Add the eggs one at a time, stirring vigorously after each one. When the batter looks thick, shiny, and well blended, add the flour and stir until you cannot see it any longer, then beat vigorously for 40 strokes with the wooden spoon or a rubber spatula. Spread evenly in the baking pan on top of the graham crackers. (Since this is a thick batter, I found that it worked well to drop the dough in large tablespoons all over the graham crackers, and then smooth those out with a spoon to form an even layer of brownie batter.) Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center emerges slightly moist with batter, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove pan and sprinkle generously with mini marshmallows. Turn oven to broil, then return the pan to the oven and cook for about 3-5 minutes, or until the marshmallows poof up and JUST barely begin to turn golden.

Stir slowly until the chocolate is completely melted and the mixture is smooth. Let it cool until it reaches room temperature, about 1-2 hours. It will continue to thicken the longer it sets. Spoon or pipe the ganache onto the cupcakes. If the ganache is too thin for piping, you can transfer it to the bowl of a stand mixer and beat it on medium-high for 3-5 minutes until it reaches a better consistency for piping.","Cupcake Ingredients:  1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, softened 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar 2 eggs 2 tsp. vanilla extract 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 cup dark chocolate cocoa powder (or any unsweetened cocoa powder) 1 tsp. baking soda 1/4 tsp. salt 1/2 cup buttermilk 1/2 cup coffee, lukewarm (you can use decaf coffee if desired!) chocolate ganache frosting coarse sea salt, for sprinkling  Chocolate Ganache Frosting Ingredients:  18 ounces dark chocolate, chopped 1 1/2 cups heavy cream"

In a stand mixer using the whisk attachment, beat the eggs at high speed until the volume doubles (about 5 minutes). Meanwhile, melt the chocolate and butter together. You can either do this on the stove (by placing the chocolate and butter in a large heatproof bowl set over a pan of almost-simmering water until smooth and very warm – about 115 degrees on an instant-read thermometer – stirring occasionally). Or you can do this in the microwave (by heating the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl at 50% power for 2 minutes, then stirring, the adding the butter, and continuing to heat at 50% power and stir in 1-minute intervals until the mixture is well-melted and smooth). Then fold about a third of the beaten eggs into the chocolate mixture using a large rubber spatula until only a few streaks of egg are visible. Fold in half of the remaining egg foam, and then the last half of the foam, until the mixture is streak-free and smooth. Scrape the batter into the mini cheesecake pans, filling each cup about 2/3 full. (I used about 5 tablespoons of batter per cake.) Bake until the cakes have risen slightly, the edges are just beginning to set, a thin-glazed crust (like a brownie) has formed on the surface, and an instant-read thermometer inserted halfway into the center reads 140° F, 14-18 minutes.

Grease two 9-inch round cake pans, line bottoms with parchment, grease parchment, and flour. (**I used two 6-inch round cake pans, although there is enough batter for three 6-inch cake pans if desired. You can follow Wilton’s guidelines for cake sizes and batter here. Transfer strawberries to bowl, cover, and microwave until strawberries are soft and have released their juice, about 5-7 minutes, stirring once halfway through. Place strawberries in a fine-mesh strainer set over small saucepan. Firmly press fruit dry (juice should measure at least 3/4 cup); discard strawberry solids. Bring juice to boil over medium-high heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until syrupy and reduced to 1/4 cup, 6 to 8 minutes. Whisk together strawberry juice, milk, egg whites, and vanilla in bowl, and set aside. Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt on low speed until combined. Add butter, 1 piece at a time, and mix until only pea-size pieces remain, about 1 minute. Add half of strawberry mixture, increase speed to medium-high, and beat until light and fluffy, about 1 minute. Reduce speed to medium-low, add remaining milk mixture, and beat until incorporated, about 30 seconds. Give batter final stir by hand, being sure to mix in any clumps on the bottom of the pan. Scrape equal amounts of batter into two prepared 9-inch round pans, and bake until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes, rotating pans halfway through baking. (Or if using 6-inch round pans, pour 2 cups of batter into each prepared pan, bake until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, baking 25 to 30 minutes.) Cool cakes in pans on wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove cakes from pans, discarding parchment, and cool completely, about 2 hours. Use a knife or a cake leveler to level out the cakes so that they are perfectly flat. Then add a thick and even layer of frosting on top of the first cake, and set the second cake on top. Continue to frost the entire cake with a very thin layer of frosting for the “crumb coat” (to seal in the crumbs). Then go back over the entire cake and frost with a thicker layer of frosting for the final coat. Layer with conversation hearts, beginning at the bottom and working your way to the top and center. (**You will want to work as quickly as possible so that the frosting stays moist for sticking.**) Serve immediately, or store in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.  To Make The Frosting:  In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the cream cheese and butter on medium speed until smooth.

Don’t worry about getting it perfectly shaped. Then freeze the ball for at least 1-2 hours. Remove the ball, and continue shaping into your preferred shape. Unwrap the ball, and place on a serving plate. Then garnish with chocolate chips if you would like.

dessert,Cinnamon Mini-Cheesecakes With Pumpkin Pie Frosting,"To Make Gingersnap Crust:  Prepare 12 baking cups with paper liners, or grease with cooking spray. In a separate bowl, whisk together the three crust ingredients until well blended. Scoop 1 packed tablespoon of crust into each baking cup, and press down to pack firm. Bake for 10 minutes at 350 degrees, then remove and set aside.  To Make Cinnamon Cheesecakes:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Begin to boil a large kettle or pot of water for the water bath. In the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine the cream cheese and sugar, then mix on medium-speed until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time, fully incorporating each before adding the next. Make sure to scrape down the bowl in between each egg. Add heavy cream, vanilla and cinnamon, and mix until smooth. Do not overmix. Pour batter into each crust-prepared baking cup until 3/4 full. Once your kettle or pot of water is boiling, carefully place a large baking dish on the lower rack of your oven and pull the rack out a few inches towards you, and then pour the water into it. (Or use your best judgment on how to do this without burning yourself. I just heat the water in a kettle, which is very easy to pour into the pan.) This will create a water bath that will give off lots of steam while the cheesecake bakes. Then place the cheesecake pan in the oven, and bake for about 25 minutes, or until the edges appear to be set and the center still has a slight jiggle to it. Turn off the oven and open the oven door slightly for 5 minutes. Then remove the pan and place on a cooling rack until completely cooled. Top with pumpkin pie frosting.  To Make Pumpkin Pie Frosting:  Preheat oven to 425 degrees. In a mixing bowl, whisk together all ingredients until well blended. Pour into a greased 9-inch pie pan and bake for 30-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the pie comes out clean. Remove and let cool, then refrigerate. When ready to “frost” the cheesecakes, remove the pumpkin pie and spoon the filling into a piping bag. Use as you would regular frosting.","Gingersnap Crust:  1 cup gingersnap cookie (or graham cracker) crumbs 1/4 cup (half stick) unsalted butter; melted pinch of salt  Cheesecake:  2 bars of cream cheese (8 oz each), room temperature 1/2 cup plus 2 Tbsp. granulated sugar 2 large eggs, room temperature 1/3 cup heavy cream 1/2 Tbsp. pure vanilla extract 1 Tbsp. ground cinnamon  Pumpkin Pie “Frosting” (**recommend cooking this first**):  1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree 3/4 cup packed brown sugar 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice 2 eggs 1/2 cup evaporated milk 1/2 cup heavy cream"

dessert,Angel Food Cake,"Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and heat the oven to 325 F degrees. Prepare an ungreased large 9-inch tube pan, preferably with a removable bottom. If the pan bottom is not removable, line it with parchment or waxed paper. Whisk together the flour and 3/4 cup of the sugar in a small bowl. Place the remaining 3/4 cup sugar in another small bowl. Using a whisk attachment, beat the egg whites in the bowl of a standing mixer at low speed until just broken up and beginning to froth. Add the cream of tartar and salt and beat at medium speed until the whites form very soft, billowy mounds. With the mixer still at medium speed, beat in the remaining 3/4 cup sugar, one tablespoon at a time, until all the sugar is added and the whites are shiny and form soft peaks. (If you lift the beater up from the batter, the top of the peaks will droop down slightly.) Add in the vanilla, lemon (or orange) juice, and almond extract and beat until just blended. Sift about 3 tablespoons of the flour-sugar mixture into the egg white mixture, then gently folding it in, using a large rubber spatula. Repeat until all of the flour-sugar mixture is incorporated (this will take about 6-8 batches). Gently scrape the batter into the tube pan, smooth the top with a spatula, removing any large air bubbles. Bake until the cake is golden brown and the top springs back when pressed firmly, 50-60 minutes. If the cake pan has prongs around the rim, invert the pan onto them once it is removed from the oven. If the pan does not have prongs, invert the pan onto the neck of a bottle. Let the cake cool completely, 2-3 hours. To remove the cake, gently run a knife around the edge of the pan, being careful not to separate the golden crust from the cake. Slide the cake out of the pan and cut the same way around the removable bottom to release, or peel off the parchment or waxed paper, if using. Place the cake bottom-side up on a serving platter or pedestal. Cut the slices by sawing gently with a long serrated knife. Serve cake immediately or cover.","1 cup sifted cake flour 1 1/2 cups sifted sugar 12 large egg whites (about 1 3/4 cups), room temperature 1 tsp. cream of tartar 1/4 tsp. salt 2 tsp. vanilla extract 1 tsp. fresh lemon juice (or orange juice) 1/2 tsp. almond extract"

Press the crumbs into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan (or six 4-inch mini springforms). Bake for 6 minutes, then remove and set aside. Meanwhile, in the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the PHILADELPHIA Brand Cream Cheese on medium-high speed until smooth. Gradually mix in the sugar. Add in the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the lime juice and lime zest until just combined. Pour the filling over the cooked graham cracker crust. To minimize cracking, place a shallow pan (I used an oven-proof 9×13-inch pan) half full of hot water on the bottom rack of the oven during baking. Bake for 55-65 minutes or until the center is set (25-33 minutes for mini springforms). Turn the oven off and prop the door open about 4 inches. Let the cheesecake stand 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and transfer to a wire rack. Let cool 10 minutes. Carefully remove the sides of the pan and let cool to room temperature on the rack. Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours before slicing and serving. Serve drizzled with cherry sauce, and topped with a lime and cherry if desired. To Make The Sauce: In a medium saucepan, stir together cherries and sugar over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the cherries begin to release some of their juices and the mixture is simmering. Combine the cornstarch and water in a small bowl; whisk until smooth. Add the cornstarch mixture to the blackberries and mix well. Reduce the heat to medium and let cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture comes to a low boil and thickens slightly, then remove from heat. If you’d like a smooth sauce, you can then press the mixture through a fine mesh sieve to remove the seeds. Or serve as is with the whole cherries. The sauce will thicken as it cools.","Lime Cheesecake Ingredients:  2 cups graham cracker crumbs 6 Tbsp. sugar 6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted 3 (8 oz.) packages PHILADELPHIA Brand Cream Cheese 1 cup sugar 3 large eggs juice of 2 limes (about 2 Tbsp. per lime) zest of 2 limes  Cherry Sauce Ingredients:  12 oz. cherries, rinsed and drained (frozen berries work too!) 2 Tbsp. sugar 2 tsp. cornstarch 2 tsp. cold water"

Finish of with a layer of whipped cream, and top with the remaining Twix bars. Serve immediately or refrigerate up to 8 hours.  To Make Salted Caramel Mousse:  Briefly stir together granulated sugar and water in a small saucepan, then bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Continue cooking, without stirring, until mixture turns dark amber in color, about 6 to 7 minutes. (Keep an eye on it, though, because it goes from clear to amber very quickly!) Remove from heat and slowly add in cream (just start with a tablespoon or two), stirring with a wooden spoon until completely smooth. (Be careful, as the mixture will definitely bubble up and possibly splatter a bit as you add in the cream.) Stir in vanilla and salt. Set aside until it reaches room temperature, or refrigerate to speed up the process. In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat PHILADELPHIA Cream Cheese on medium-high speed for 1 minute until very smooth.

End with the last third of the flour mixture, beat until well combined, making sure to scrape down the bowl with a spatula. In a small bowl, mix vinegar and baking soda. (Yes, it will fizz!) Add vinegar mixture to the cake batter and stir well to combine. Fill cupcake cups with cake batter until they are about 3/4 full. (I like to use an ice-cream scoop for this!) Bake for approximately 20-22 minutes, rotating pans halfway through. Cupcakes are done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Check early and don’t overbake! Cool the cupcakes in their tins on a wire rack for 10 minutes then remove and allow to cool completely before frosting.  To Make Frosting:  To make the frosting, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment beat the cream cheese and butter on medium-high speed until well combined and smooth, about 2-3 minutes. Mix in the vanilla extract. Gradually beat in the powdered sugar until totally incorporated, increase the speed and then beat until smooth.

dessert,Oreo Cookies and Cream Cheesecakes,"Preheat oven to 275° F. On the bottom shelf, place an oven-proof pan (any size will work) and fill with 2 cups of water. This will heat and make the “water bath” so that the cupcakes do not crack when baking. Line standard muffin tins with paper liners. Place 1 whole Oreo cookie in the bottom of each lined muffin cup. In the bowl of a stand mixer, fitted with the paddle attachment, beat cream cheese on medium-high speed until smooth, scraping down sides of the bowl as needed. Gradually add the sugar, and beat until combined. Beat in the vanilla. Drizzle in eggs, a little at a time, beating to combine and scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Add in sour cream and salt, beat to combine. Using a large spatula, fold in the chopped Oreo cookies. Divide batter evenly among the cookie-filled muffin cups, fill each cup almost to the top. Bake, rotating muffin tins halfway through, until the filling is set, about 22 to 28 minutes. Transfer the muffins tins to a wire rack to cool completely. Refrigerate (in the muffin tins) at least 4 hours (or overnight). Remove from tins just before serving. Top with whipped cream if you’d like.","42 Oreos (cream-filled chocolate sandwich cookies) 30 left whole and 12 coarsely chopped 2 pounds (4 blocks) cream cheese, room temperature 1 cup sugar 1 tsp. pure vanilla extract 4 large eggs, room temperature, lightly beaten 1 cup sour cream pinch of salt whipped cream, homemade or store-bought (optional)"
dessert,Chocolate Mint Puddles,"In a separate bowl, mix flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir dry ingredients into the chocolate mixture. Cover and refrigerate dough for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350F. Roll cookie dough into small balls and place on cookie sheets, approximately 2 inches apart. Bake for 8-10 minutes. After removing cookie sheet from oven, press a mint into each cookie and allow to sit for one minute, melting slightly. (If the mints don’t melt enough — as mine didn’t — feel free to pop the cookies with the mints on top back in the oven for an extra 30 seconds to soften the chocolate.) Then, using a toothpick, swirl the melted mint to make a pattern. Allow to cool before serving.",3/4 cup butter 1 1/2 cups brown sugar 2 Tbsp. water 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips 2 eggs 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/4 tsp. baking soda 1/2 tsp. salt 3 (4.5 oz) packages Andes mints
dessert,Fleur de Sel Caramels,"Line the bottom of an 8-inch square baking pan (or loaf pan) with parchment paper, then brush the paper lightly with oil (or lightly cover with cooking spray), allowing the paper to drape over 2 sides. In a deep saucepan (6 inches diameter by 4 1/2 inches deep) combine the sugar, corn syrup, and 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Continue to boil until the caramel is a warm golden brown color. Don’t stir – just swirl the pan to mix. Watch carefully, as it will burn quickly at the end! In the meantime, bring the cream, butter, and 1 teaspoon fleur de sel to a simmer in a small pan over medium heat. Remove from the heat, set aside and keep warm. When the caramelized sugar is the right color, very slowly add the cream mixture to the caramel while stirring – it will boil up violently. Stir in the vanilla with a wooden spoon and cook over medium heat for 5 to 10 minutes, until the mixture reaches 248 degrees F (firm ball) on a candy thermometer. Very carefully (it’s hot!) pour the caramel into the prepared pan and refrigerate until firm.  For rolled caramels:  When the caramels are cool, use the parchment paper to pry the sheet from the pan onto a cutting board. Starting at 1 end, roll the caramel up tightly until you’ve rolled up half of the sheet. Cut the sheet across and then roll the second half tightly. You will have 2 (1 by 8-inch) logs. Sprinkle both logs lightly with fleur de sel, cut each log in 8 pieces. Cut parchment papers (or wax paper) in 6 by 4 1/2-inch squares and wrap each caramel in a paper, twisting the ends. Store in the refrigerator or at room temperature.  For square/cubed caramels:  When the caramels are cool, use the parchment paper to pry the sheet from the pan onto a cutting board. Then use a large knife to carefully cut the caramel into squares of your desired size.","1/2 cup sugar 1/4 cup light corn syrup 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 5 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 teaspoon fleur de sel, plus extra for sprinkling 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract parchment paper or wax paper, for wrapping"
dessert,Pumpkin Pie Biscotti,"Preheat oven to 350*F. Combine flour, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, and pumpkin pie spice in a large bowl; stir well. In another bowl, combine pumpkin, eggs, and vanilla, stirring well with a wire whisk. Slowly add pumpkin mixture to flour mixture, stirring until dry ingredients are moistened. (Mixture will be very crumbly; it will gradually become moist after stirring.) Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; add nuts. Cook, stirring constantly, until nuts are browned. Remove from heat and cool completely. Knead or gently stir cooled nuts into dough. Place dough on a lightly floured surface and divide into 2 portions. Lightly flour hands and shape each portion into a 2 x 10? long log. (Or I just made one large 8″ x 16″ log.) Place logs 3? apart on lightly greased cookie sheet. Bake for 24 minutes; cool logs 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 300 F. After some cooling, move a loaf to a cutting board and cut diagonally into 1/2? thick pieces. Do the same to the other loaf. The interior of each biscotto should still be just a little moist (while the exterior is nice and hard). The crust of the loaf will probably be quite hard, so use a large serrated knife such as a bread knife for this job. Place the biscotti with a cut side facing up on a half sheet pan and bake for 8 minutes. Remove the pan and flip all the biscotti over so the other cut side is now facing up. Bake for another 7 minutes. Set all the pieces on a wire rack to cool making sure that none of the biscotti are touching each other. If the biscotti are placed too close together, they could get a little soft or soggy as they cool. Once the biscotti have fully cooled, they can be consumed as is, or white chocolate dipped or drizzled. To melt the chocolate, pop it in the microwave and heat for 30 seconds, then stir. Then continue heating in 15-second increments (carefully) and stirring in between until chocolate is melted. (I usually add in a little shortening to help it melt and avoid burning.) Then just dip a fork in the chocolate and swish it over biscotti to drizzle, or you can pour it in a Ziplock or pastry bag (with a tiny corner snipped out) and squeeze it out. The biscotti tastes best during the first few days, but will keep for up to a month in a sealed air-tight container.","3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/2 cups firmly packed brown sugar 2 tsp. baking powder 1/2 tsp. salt 2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice, store-bought or homemade (see tip below for substitution) 1/2 cup pumpkin puree 2 large eggs, lightly beaten 1 Tbsp. vanilla paste (or 1 Tbsp. vanilla extract) 2 Tbsp. butter or margarine 1 1/4 cup pecans or walnuts, coarsely chopped 1/4 cup melted white chocolate, for drizzling or dipping (optional)"
dessert,Vanilla Chai Cupcakes,"Cupcake Directions:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Prepare a cupcake pan with liners. In a small bowl or plastic bag, combine the chai spice mix ingredients. Set aside. Cream together the butter and sugar. Add the vanilla and beat in one egg at a time. Stir in 2 teaspoons of the chai spice mix. Fold in the flour and buttermilk alternately and stir until combined, don’t over mix. Mix together the baking soda and vinegar in a separate bowl, then add it to the batter and mix until combined. Spoon into prepared cupcake tins until 3/4 full and bake 15-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.  Buttercream Directions:  In a stand mixer, beat the butter until it is creamy. On low, mix in the vanilla and the rest of the chai spice mix. Carefully beat in the powdered sugar about ½ cup at a time. If the buttercream is too thick add 1-2 tbs of cold milk until the desired consistency is reached. Then pipe onto cooled cupcakes with your favorite frosting tip. (I used a 1M Wilton tip.)","Cupcake Ingredients:  1/2 cup (1 stick) butter 1 cup sugar 2 tsp. vanilla extract, store-bought or homemade 2 eggs 2 tsp. chai spice mix (recipe below) 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, sifted 1/2 cup buttermilk 1/2 tsp. baking soda 1/2 tsp. apple cider vinegar  Chai Spice Mix Ingredients:  1 1/2 tsp. ground cardamom 1 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon 1/2 tsp. ground ginger 1/4 tsp. ground cloves 1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg  Buttercream Ingredients:  1 cup (2 sticks) butter 1 tsp. vanilla extract, store-bought or homemade 2 cups powdered sugar, sifted remainder of the chai spice mix 1 Tbsp. cold milk, if needed to thin out the buttercream"
dessert,Apple Cider Cups,"On a cutting board or sturdy surface, use a knife to cut off the top of the apple. Then take a paring knife and carefully outline where you’d like the “rim” of your apple cup to be. (My rims were about 1/4″ wide.) Use a spoon to carefully begin scooping out the center of your apple until you have a nice “cup”. (A melon baller also works well for this.) Also, if your apple doesn’t sit exactly level, take your paring knife and just slice off a few millimeters to even off the bottom to make it even. Just be careful not to let your knife cut through the bottom or sides of the apple when hollowing it out, or the cider will leak out! Once you have the inside of the apples hollowed out, brush a little lemon juice over the inside of the apples (to prevent browning). Then fill with your favorite apple cider, garnish with cinnamon or spices if you’d like, and serve!","large apples lemon juice apple cider, either homemade or store-bought optional: cinnamon sticks, whole cloves, allspice and/or star anise for garnish"
dessert,Apple Nachos,"After slicing the apples, immediately dip them in lemon juice (or give them a good sprinkle) so that they do not brown. Set aside.

Thaw the puff pastry according to package instructions. Remove the pastry from the refrigerator and place sheets on a clean, dry surface. Use a small, sharp knife to cut the each pastry along their two long folds (so that each sheet is divided into 3 long rectangles.). Then cut each rectangle into four smaller rectangles (so that they each measure about 2″ x 3″). Half of these will become the rectangle “bases”, and half the rectangle “frames”. To make the “frames”, take half of the rectangles and cut out their centers so that approximately 1/2″ of pastry makes a frame around the edges. (See photo.) Then lightly brush the “bases” with water around the edges, and lay the “frames” on top of them, pressing gently together. Transfer the “frame”/”base” combos to two large cookie sheets lined with parchment paper (or well-greased cookie sheets), so that you have 12 per sheet. (Be sure that they’re about 2″ apart. Depending on the size of your cookie sheets, you may need to spread them out over 3 sheets…) Fill the inside of each frame with about 1 tablespoon of the ricotta mixture. Then brush the edges of the frame with egg white. Transfer sheet to the oven, and cook for about 15-18 minutes, or until the puff pastry is fully “puffed” and begins to turn slightly golden.

(If the chocolate is too thick, add in a few teaspoons of shortening until it reaches your desired consistency.) Then use a fork to drizzle it over the mints. Let the mints cool before removing.  Craftyness:  You can certainly use Altoid tins for this project. Or, to save a little cash and also have plain silver-colored tins (without the colorful Altoids label), order a batch of “hinge-top metal tins” online here or here. I then just cut out scrapbook paper to fit the top and attached it with sticky mounting squares. (Be careful if you use glue, as it can wrinkle the paper.) Then used silver stickers to spell out names (or a greeting) on the front. You can also attach a tiny mirror to the inside of the lid, or write in a fun quote or note if you’d like!  Other fun ideas for the tins might be:  filling with little glass-pebble magnets (a cute gift idea, since the magnets stick to the metal!) creating a “first date kit” for a friend (lip gloss, a tiny mirror, and mints!) filling with gum, candy, or mints holding credit cards, gift cards, photos, etc.","Altoids, or butter/pastel mints dark chocolate chips (or other favorite chocolate chips, or almond bark)"

dessert,Peanut Butter Rice Crispy Treats,"To Make Turkey Crispy Treats  Melt butter in a pan over medium heat (with peanut butter if using). When melted, add marshmallows and stir until melted. Remove from heat. Add cereal and mix well. While still warm, use your hands to form the mixture into small balls. Then use additional peanut butter for “glue” to tack on the candy corn (feathers), Whopper (head), beak (cashew), little red waddle (licorice), and then use black frosting to make the eyes. You may need to squish these down slightly so that there’s a flat part on the bottom, in order to help the “bird” balance. :)  To Make Rice Crispy Bars  Grease a 9×13-inch baking dish. Melt butter in a pan over medium heat (with peanut butter if using). When melted, add marshmallows and stir until melted. Remove from heat. Add cereal and mix well. If using sprinkles, add sprinkles and mix well (add more, and some more). Pour contents into baking dish and spread evenly. When cooled, cut into squares and serve. *I recommend using regular peanut butter, not natural peanut butter, for maximum stickyness.","Rice Crispy Treats Ingredients:  1/4 cup butter* 10 oz marshmallows 6 cups rice crispy cereal 1/2 cup peanut butter (omit if making classic flavor)  Turkey Decor:  candy corn cashews (split in half, and then broken in two) Whoppers (or other round, brown candy) black frosting red licorice (I used Twizzlers “Pull & Peel”) – or a dried cranberry might work more peanut butter for “glue”"
dessert,Peppermint Mocha Cupcakes,"To Make Cupcakes:  Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350°F. Line a standard 12-cup muffin pan with paper or foil liners. (Or if using nut cups, as pictured above, lay them out on a cookie sheet.) Stir together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. In a measuring cup, combine the milk and brewed coffee. In a medium bowl, using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat the butter and sugars together until light and fluffy, 2-3 minutes. Add the egg and beat until combined. Add the flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with the milk mixture in 2 additions, beating on low speed until just combined; scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups, filling each about 2/3 full. (Depending on how full you fill them, this recipe will make 12-16 cupcakes.) Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 16-20 minutes. Let the cupcakes cool in the pan on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Transfer the cupcakes to the wire rack and let cool completely before frosting.  To Make Frosting:  In a medium bowl, using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, mix together cream cheese, butter, vanilla and peppermint extract. Gradually add powdered sugar, mixing well until it’s all incorporated. Use immediately or refrigerate. The frosting will harden in the fridge, so plan on bring it back to room temperature if you must refrigerate it before frosting the cupcakes.","Mocha Cupcake Ingredients:  1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 1 tsp baking powder 1/2 tsp baking soda 1/4 tsp salt 1/2 cup whole milk 1/2 cup strong brewed coffee, at room temperature 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar 1 large egg, at room temperature  Frosting Ingredients:  8 oz.

dessert,Chocolate Guinness Cupcakes,"To Make Cupcakes:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a 12-cup cupcake pan with cupcake papers; spray the whole thing, cupcake papers and all, with nonstick spray. Set aside. Melt butter in microwave or on stove top, then set aside. In a mixing bowl, whisk together eggs and yogurt. Add beer and vanilla whisk until well combined. Sift all the dry ingredients together (cocoa powder, sugar, flour, baking soda, and cinnamon) into a separate bowl. Add about a third of the flour mixture into the wet ingredients and blend well using a mixer on low speed, or a hand mixer. Add the rest of the flour mixture, a third at a time, mixing well after each addition. When all ingredients are blended, add the melted butter then continue mixing until very well combined. Pour batter into the 12 cups, filling each only about 3/4 full. (Since the batter is not super-thick, I found it easier to use a measuring cup or other cup with a spout to pour the batter into the muffin cups, rather than spooning it in.) Bake on center rack of the preheated 350 degree oven and for approximately 25 minutes. When cupcakes are done (toothpick inserted in center of a cupcake will come out clean), remove the pan to a wire rack. Let cool for ten minutes then remove cupcakes from pan and let them cool completely on wire rack.  To Make Frosting:  In a medium bowl, blend together cream cheese, butter, and vanilla. Gradually add powdered sugar, mixing well until it’s all incorporated. Use immediately.

Toss in the cubed butter and give it a few long buzzes, until it resembles coarse cornmeal. Toss in the egg and vanilla and buzz a couple more times, until a very soft dough forms. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for a couple hours. Roll the dough out (about 1/8″ thick) and use a cookie cutter (or a drinking glass) to cut into circles. Add a dollop of jam (about 1 heaping tsp.) to the middle of each circle and gently fold the edges inward, overlapping in the middle. Or you could just fold it into a half circle and completely close the pocket, but then you can’t see what kind of jam you’re getting before you bite into it. :) Bake for about 10 minutes.

appetizers,Baked Blooming Onion,"To Make The Blooming Onion:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees. On a cutting board, use a knife to cut off the top (not the root) 1/4-inch of the onion until a few of the inside layers are exposed. Peel the outermost layer of the onion down to the root, but leave the root intact. Lay the onion on the cutting board so that the flat side (that you just cut) is facing downward. Then use a knife to section the onion into 16ths, beginning with your knife 1/8-inch away from the root and cutting straight down. Once all cuts are complete, turn the onion over and set on a piece of parchment paper on a baking sheet. Then use your fingers to gently spread apart the petals. If any of your cuts did not go all the way through, you can use a paring knife to be sure that the entire onion is cut into 16ths. (Update: I have had readers give the tip that if you soak your sliced onion in cold water overnight, it will open up naturally on its own.) In a separate small bowl, whisk together the Panko, Cajun seasoning and salt until combined. In a separate (additional) bowl, whisk the eggs until combined. Beginning with the lowest (bottom) layers of the onion, brush the top of each petal with the egg mixture until coated, then immediately sprinkle with the Panko mixture. Repeat until all petals are coated. (The panko won’t totally “stick” when the egg is wet, but just press it on with your fingers.) It is kind of tedious, but worth it! Carefully form a tent with aluminum foil over the baking sheet until the onion is completely enclosed. Bake for 5 minutes, then remove tent and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes until the onion is soft and the tips are lightly crisped. Remove and serve with desired sauces.

appetizers,Stuffed Caprese Bites,"To Make The Caprese Bites: Preheat oven to 400°F. Grease a pie plate with cooking spray. If using canned pizza dough, use a pizza slicer to cut dough into 24 equal squares.

Make each of the bites by slicing a tomato in two lengthwise, and then sandwiching a piece of cheese and a torn piece of basil between the tomato halves. Then gently place the little tomato sandwich in the center of the pizza dough, and wrap the dough around it to make a ball. Pinch the ends together so that they are secure, then place each ball seam-side-down in the greased pie pan. Repeat with remaining ingredients until the pan is full. Brush the tops of the little dough balls with melted butter, then sprinkle with the dried oregano. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the tops are slightly golden. Remove and serve immediately.

breakfast,Freezer Breakfast Burritos,"Begin by making your scrambled eggs. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, and a generous pinch of salt and pepper until smooth. Heat a large saute pan that has been misted with cooking spray (or spread with a teaspoon of oil) on the skillet over medium heat, then add the eggs and cook for 4-­6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they are scrambled and cooked through. Transfer to a separate plate and set aside. Meanwhile, while your eggs are cooking, heat the 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large saute pan over medium­high heat. Add onion and saute for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onion is mostly cooked and slightly translucent. Add the potatoes and bell peppers, and stir to combine. Continue cooking, stirring frequently, for 7­-10 more minutes, or until the potatoes are tender and cooked through. Stir in the black beans, green chiles, salt and cumin, and continue cooking for 2 more minutes. Then remove the mixture from the heat, and set aside.

Add a large spoonful of scrambled eggs in the center of the tortilla (roughly 1/4 cup), followed by another large spoonful of the potato mixture on top of the eggs, followed by a few tablespoons of shredded cheese on top of the potato mixture. Fold the two opposite sides of the tortilla in so that they meet and overlap, then fold in the two remaining open ends so that the entire burrito is sealed. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap so that the entire burrito is very tightly sealed. (I find it easiest to fold the plastic wrap over the two short ends, then the longer sides of the burrito.) Then transfer burritos to the freezer, where they will last for up to 3 months. To thaw the frozen burritos, remove the plastic wrap and place a burrito on a microwave­safe plate. Microwave for 60-­90 seconds, or until warmed through.

breakfast,Brown Butter Cinnamon Rolls,"To Make The Brown Butter:  Before you begin making the dough and filling, prepare your brown butter. To make brown butter in the microwave, place butter in a large microwaveable bowl and heat for 3-5 minutes, or until the butter has come to a boil and then turns an amber color. Be careful that the butter does not burn. To make brown butter on the stove, place butter in a large saucepan and heat over medium-high heat until boiling. Let the butter boil for 2-4 minutes, or until it turns an amber color. Be careful that the butter does not burn.  To Make The Dough & Filling:  Pour the milk into a microwave-safe bowl. Heat on high in the microwave for 30 seconds, then remove and stir in the melted brown butter, and test the temperature with your finger. You want the mixture to be lukewarm, but not hot to the touch. If it is too cool, continue heating the mixture in the microwave for 20 second intervals, pausing after each to stir, until the mixture reaches the correct temperature. If the mixture gets too hot, let it sit out for a few minutes until it has cooled to the lukewarm temperature. In a separate bowl, whisk together 3 cups flour (not all of the flour), sugar and salt until combined. In the bowl of a stand mixer (**see note below for an alternative method of making this by hand*) fitted with the dough hook attachment, add yeast and lukewarm milk mixture and stir by hand to combine. Add the flour mixture and egg, and beat on medium-low speed until combined. If the dough is sticking to the sides of the bowl, add the remaining flour, 1/4 cup at a time, until the dough begins to form a ball and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Continue beating for 5 minutes on medium-low speed. Remove the dough hook and cover the bowl with a damp towel and let rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, make your filling by whisking together sugars and cinnamon in a bowl until evenly combined. When the dough is ready, turn it out onto a floured work surface. Then use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about 14 x 10 inches in size. (If you want all edges to be even, you can use a pizza slicer to cut the dough into a perfect rectangle.) Use a knife or pastry spatula to spread the melted brown butter evenly over the entire surface of the dough. Then sprinkle the cinnamon and sugar mixture evenly on top of the melted butter so that the entire surface of the dough is covered. Beginning at the 14-inch edge, tightly roll up the dough. And then give the final seam a little pinch so that it seals. Use a piece of dental floss*** to “cut” off the two ends of the roll (an inch on each end) so that they are even, then discard the dough that was cut away. Use the floss to cut the remaining dough into 12 equal pieces. (***To cut dough with dental floss, simply break off a piece of floss about 12 inches long. Then very carefully slide the middle of the floss under the dough to the place where you want to “cut”. Then pull the ends of the floss up and cross over the top of the dough, and give a quick tug to literally cut all the way through the dough. This is the best method for not squishing your dough while cutting it — although the standard knife method still works too.) Place each of the cut cinnamon rolls into a greased pie plate or 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Then cover again with a damp towel, and leave the dish in a warm place to rise for 25 minutes. While the dough is rising, make the icing (instructions below). When the rolls have risen, uncover the dish. Then place on the center rack of the oven and bake at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes, or until the rolls are golden and cooked through. Remove and let cool on a wire rack for at least 5 minutes. Drizzle with frosting and serve.  To Make The Brown Butter Cream Cheese Frosting:  Either in the bowl of an electric stand mixer, or a mixing bowl, whisk the melted brown butter and cream cheese together until combined. Add in powdered sugar and whisk until combined. If the icing is too thick, add a tablespoon or two of milk to thin it out.","Dough Ingredients:  1 cup milk (I used 2%) 1/4 cup (melted) brown butter (*see instructions for brown butter below) 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, divided 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1/2 tsp. salt 1 envelope instant or ‘rapid rise’ yeast (approx. 2 1/4 tsp) 1 egg  Cinnamon-Sugar Filing Ingredients:  1/3 cup granulated sugar 1/3 cup packed brown sugar 2 Tbsp. ground cinnamon 1/3 cup (melted) brown butter  Brown Butter Cream Cheese Frosting Ingredients:  2 Tbsp.

When the dough is ready, turn it out onto a floured work surface. Then use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about 14 x 9 inches in size. (If you want all edges to be even, you can use a pizza slicer to cut the dough into a perfect rectangle.) Use a knife or spoon to spread the Nutella evenly over the top of the surface, leaving a 1/4-inch border at the bottom of the 14-inch edge (so that the Nutella doesn’t ooze out). Sprinkle the cinnamon evenly on top of the Nutella. (If it’s too thick, pop the Nutella in the microwave for a few seconds to make it easier to spread.) Beginning at the top 14-inch edge (the edge with the Nutella spread clear to the border), tightly roll up the dough. Then give the final seam a little pinch so that it seals. Use a piece of dental floss*** to “cut” off the two ends of the roll (an inch on each end – discard that dough) so that they are even. Then cut the remaining dough into 11 or 12 equal pieces. (11 rolls seem to fit in a pie plate, while 12 rolls fit in a rectangular pan.) Place each of the cut cinnamon rolls into a greased pie plate or 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Then cover again with a damp towel, and leave the dish in a warm place to rise for 25 minutes. (I typically turn on my oven to 200 degrees, then turn it off and place the dish in the oven with the door cracked open. It’s a great option if you don’t have a vent or a warm window nearby.)

Set a timer to go off every ten minutes while the granola bakes, so you can rotate the pans and give the granola a good stir; this helps it to cook evenly.

drinks,Pour-Over Coffee,"In an electric kettle, teapot or water heater, bring about 3.5 cups water to a *boil (see note below).  Meanwhile, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh 48 grams of coffee beans. Grind the beans using a hand or electric grinder to medium coarseness. Place a filter in the top of the Chemex, and with the double-folded side of the filter facing the spout.  Use a slow-pouring kettle to pour the water all over the filter until it is completely soaked.  This “rinse” will help remove the paper-y taste from the filter and preheat it.  Once the filter is completely rinsed, carefully pour out the water in  the Chemex, leaving the filter in its place. Pour the coffee grinds into the bottom of the filter, and give the Chemex a small shake to even out the grounds.  Then place the Chemex on a digital scale and tare it out so that it begins at 0 grams. Using a zig-zag motion, pour water over the grounds until they are completely wet (and the scale measures approximately 80 grams).  Wait 30-45 seconds for the grounds to puff up and “bloom”, which allows the gasses to release from the coffee grounds. Then starting from the center and moving outward in slow concentric circles, continue pouring water in a steady stream to rewet the grounds, careful not to pour directly along the edges of the filter.  Pour until the scale measures 300 grams, then wait for the water to mostly drain. Pour another round of water over the grounds in concentric circles until the scale measures 600 grams, then wait for the water to mostly drain. Then pour a final round of water over the grounds in concentric circles until the scale measures 750 grams. Once most (not all) of the water has drained from the final round, carefully remove the filter.  (Be careful, it’s hot!)  Don’t wait until all of the water has drained out, or else some of the final drops can be really bitter.

Then fill in the center, and THEN you can start adding in larger spoonfuls on top of that. (Repeat with the third layer.)

baked-goods,Swedish Cinnamon Buns (Kanelbullar),"Heat the milk and butter. Combine the milk and 1/4 cup butter in a small saucepan*.  Heat over medium-low heat, stirring frequently to melt the butter, until the mixture reaches 110°F. (I recommend measuring the temperature with a cooking thermometer, but if you don’t have one, the mixture should be warm but not hot to the touch. If the mixture gets too hot, just wait a few minutes for it to cool.) Mix the dough. (See optional stand mixer instructions below.) In a separate large mixing bowl, briefly whisk together the flour, sugar, yeast, ground cardamom and salt until combined.  Add the warm milk mixture and stir until the dough begins to form. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 7-10 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and soft. First dough rise. Form the dough into a ball, place it in a greased bowl and cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap.  Let the dough rise in a warm space for 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size. Mix the filling. Meanwhile, stir together the filling ingredients in a separate mixing bowl until evenly combined. Roll out the dough. Once the dough is ready to go, turn it out onto a large floured work surface.  Use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a 22 x 15-inch (55 x 38-cm) rectangle.  Carefully and evenly spread the filling mixture across the entire surface of the dough.  Then (as pictured above) fold the left third of the dough in towards the center, and fold the right third of the dough over that towards the center, like you’re folding a business letter.  Gently run the rolling pin over the dough to press out any big bubbles.  Then roll the dough out a bit more so that it forms a 15 x 8-inch (38 x 20-cm) rectangle. Form the buns. Using a pizza cutter, pastry cutter or a knife, slice the dough into even 2 x 20-cm long strips. Take one strip and twist it several times, gently stretching it as you do so until it nearly doubles in length. Grab one end of the twisted strip and loosely wrap the dough around two fingers twice, like a bandage.  Then loop the rest of the dough perpendicularly around the dough so that it forms a knot, and tuck the loose end in at the bottom.  Transfer the dough to a large parchment-covered baking sheet, and repeat with the remaining dough strips.  (Here is a great visual for twisting the dough, or you can watch my step-by-step Instagram tutorial here.) Second dough rise. Loosely cover the dough buns with a clean kitchen towel and let them rise for 45-60 minutes. Brush and sprinkle. Heat the oven to 375°F.  Brush each bun with the egg wash, then sprinkle with a pinch of pearled sugar. Bake. Bake for 15-18 minutes, or until the rolls reach your desired level of golden brown.  (I like mine just very lightly golden, so that they stay super soft.)  Transfer to a wire baking sheet and let cool for 5 minutes.  Then serve warm and enjoy!!  These rolls are best enjoyed the day that they are baked, but see tips below for storage instructions if you have leftovers.",Dough Ingredients:  1 cup milk 1/4 cup (56 grams) unsalted butter 3 1/4 cups (405 grams) all-purpose flour 1/4 cup (50 grams) white granulated sugar 2 1/4 teaspoons (7 grams) instant-rise yeast 2 teaspoons ground cardamom 3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt  Filling Ingredients:  1/2 cup (113 grams) unsalted butter 1/2 cup (100 grams) packed light brown sugar 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon ground cardamom 1 teaspoon vanilla extract  Topping Ingredients:  1 egg (whisked together with 1 tablespoon water) pearled sugar
baked-goods,Corn Tortillas,"Mix the dough: In a large mixing bowl, briefly whisk together masa harina and salt.  Gradually add 1 1/2 cups hot water, and stir the mixture with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula until an evenly-mixed dough begins to form.  Use your hands to knead the dough for 2-3 minutes in the mixing bowl until it is smooth and forms a cohesive ball.  The dough’s texture should feel springy and firm, similar to Play-Doh.  If the dough feels too wet and is sticking to your hands, add in a few extra tablespoons of flour.  If it feels too dry and crackly, add in an extra tablespoon or two of hot water.  Rest the dough. Cover the bowl with a damp kitchen towel (or paper towel) and let the dough rest for 10 minutes.  Portion the dough. Use a spoon or a medium ice cream scoop to portion the dough into a 2-tablespoon ball (35-40 grams, or about the size of a golf ball), then use your hands to roll the ball until it is nice and round.   Press the dough balls. Place the dough ball between two pieces of plastic in a tortilla press. (I use a ziplock bag; see notes below.)  Then gently press the dough ball until it forms a 4- to 5-inch tortilla.   Cook the tortilla. Heat a non-stick skillet or comal over medium-high heat.  Once the pan is nice and hot, gently peel the tortilla away from the plastic wrap and lay the tortilla flat in the skillet.  Cook the tortilla for about 40-60 seconds per side, flipping it once speckled brown spots begin to appear on the bottom of the tortilla.  The tortillas will likely bubble up while cooking, especially on the second side, which is a good sign!  Once it is cooked, transfer the tortilla to a tortilla warmer or a bowl wrapped in a clean kitchen towel, so that the tortillas do not dry out.   Repeat with the remaining tortillas. I recommend keeping the cycle going by cooking one tortilla while pressing the next dough ball at the same time.  If you notice that the skillet begins to seem too hot, just turn down the heat a bit.   Serve. The tortillas will continue to soften a bit more as they sit in a stack in your tortilla warmer (or wrapped in a towel). So I recommend using the tortillas at the bottom of the stack first — they will be the softest.  Serve however you would like and enjoy! See storage instructions below.",2 cups (240 grams) masa harina 1 1/2 to 2 cups hot water* 1 teaspoon fine sea salt
baked-goods,Rosemary Focaccia Bread,"Proof the yeast. Add warm water (about 110°F, which you can measure with a thermometer if you want to be sure it’s the right temp) and sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough attachment, and stir to combine.  Sprinkle the yeast on top of the water.  Give the yeast a quick stir to mix it in with the water.  Then let it sit for 5-10 minute until the yeast is foamy. Knead the dough.  (See alterate instructions below to knead by hand.) Set the mixer to low speed, and add gradually flour, olive oil and salt.  Increase speed to medium-low, and continue mixing the dough for 5 minutes.  (If the dough is too sticky and isn’t pulling away from the sides of the bowl, add in an extra 1/4 cup flour while it is mixing.) First dough rise. Remove dough from the mixing bowl, and use your hands to shape it into a ball.  Grease the mixing bowl (or a separate bowl) with olive oil or cooking spray, then place the dough ball back in the bowl and cover it with a damp towel.  Place in a warm location (I set mine by a sunny window) and let the dough rise for 45-60 minutes, or until it has nearly doubled in size. Second dough rise.  Turn the dough onto a floured surface, and roll it out into a large circle or rectangle until that the dough is about 1/2-inch thick*.  Cover the dough again with the damp towel, and let the dough continue to rise for another 20 minutes. Prepare the dough. Preheat oven to 400°F. Transfer the dough to a large parchment-covered baking sheet (or press it into a 9 x 13-inch baking dish).  Use your fingers to poke deep dents (seriously, poke all the way down to the baking sheet!) all over the surface of the dough.  Drizzle a tablespoon or two of olive oil evenly all over the top of the dough, and sprinkle evenly with the fresh rosemary needles and sea salt. Bake. Bake for 20 minutes, or until the dough is slightly golden and cooked through. Serve. Remove from the oven, and drizzle with a little more olive oil if desired.

beverages,Watermelon Lemonade,"Stir everything together, and serve over ice.  Feel free to garnish with lemon or watermelon slices, and/or mint! Sugar free: Any number of artificial sweeteners would work well here. (And many do not need to be boiled to dissolve, so you could just add them in directly.) Herbal: For an extra kick, add a sprig of fresh rosemary or mint leaves into the water as you boil the simple syrup. Bubbly: Substitute setlzer or sparkling water (or champagne!) for some extra fizz! Mixed: Substitute some vodka or other mixer of choice to kick it up a notch! Frozen: I imagine this would be fantastic as a slush! Or, it freezes nicely into sweet little popsickles or ice cubes. :)","1 cup fresh-squeezed lemon juice 2 cups fresh watermelon puree, strained through a coarse strainer to remove seeds 1/2 cup simple syrup (created by boiling 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup sugar together until sugar is dissolved) 2 cups cold water"
snacks,Extra-Bold Chex Mix,"Add the Chex, pretzels, Cheerios, and peanuts together in a large microwave-safe mixing bowl, and gently stir a bit to combine. In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted butter, worcestershire sauce, seasoned salt and garlic powder together until combined.  Drizzle half of the sauce evenly over the Chex mix.  Then give the mix a gentle stir to combine.  (I like to stir with a rubber spatula, to help prevent breaking the Chex.)  Repeat by drizzling the remaining sauce over the Chex mix, and stir again until combined. Microwave uncovered on high 5 to 6 minutes, thoroughly stirring every 2 minutes. Spread the mix out on parchment paper or paper towels until it has cooled to room temperature.

snacks,Beef Jerky,"Thinly-slice the steak into 1/8-inch thick strips, either with the grain (which will result in a chewier beef jerky) or against the grain (which will be more tender).  I recommend popping the steak in the freezer for 15-30 minutes before slicing so that it is easier to cut.  (Or the butchers working behind the meat counters at most grocery stores will also do this for you if you ask.) Transfer the strips of steak to a large ziplock bag*. In a separate small mixing bowl, whisk together the remaining ingredients until combined.  Pour the mixture into the ziplock bag with the steak, seal the bag, and toss until the steak is evenly coated. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 1 day. If you’re making the jerky in a dehydrator, lay the strips out in a single layer on the trays of your dehydrator.  Then follow the dehydrator’s instructions to cook the beef jerky until it is dry and firm, yet still a little bit pliable.  (With my dehydrator, that meant cooking the jerky on medium heat for about 8 hours.  But cooking times will vary based on the thickness of your meat, and the heat/brand of your dehydrator.)  Remove jerky and transfer to a sealed container.  Refrigerate for up to 1 month. If you’re making the jerky in the oven, heat oven to 175°F.  Adjust the racks to the upper-middle and lower-middle positions.  Line two large baking sheets with aluminum foil, and place wire cooling racks on top of each sheet.  Lay the strips out in a single layer on the wire racks.  Bake until the beef jerky until it is dry and firm, yet still a little bit pliable, about 4 hours, flipping the beef jerky once about halfway through.  (Cooking times will vary based on the thickness of your meat.)  Remove jerky and transfer to a sealed container.  Refrigerate for up to 1 month.",2 pounds flank steak (or eye or round or top round steak) 1/2 cup low-sodium soy sauce 2 tablespoons worcestershire sauce 2 teaspoons coarsely-ground black pepper 1 teaspoon liquid smoke 1 teaspoon onion powder 1 teaspoon seasoned salt 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
snacks,Olive Oil and Parmesan Popcorn,"Add oil to a large metal stockpot over medium-high heat. Place 3-4 individual kernels in the pan and cover.  Once they pop, uncover the pan and add in the rest of the kernels so that they form a single layer on the bottom of the pan.  Cover, and give the pot a shake so that they all get coated with the oil. Once the popcorn kernels start popping furiously, give the pot a good shake every 15 seconds or so to help the un-popped kernels fall to the bottom, which prevents burning. When the popping dies down, immediately pour the popcorn it into a large bowl, and sprinkle with the Parmesan, Italian seasoning and salt.  Toss to combine.  (*Or see below for my tip on how best to help popcorn toppings actually stick to the popcorn.) Serve and enjoy!","3–4 Tablespoons olive oil, or enough to coat the bottom of the pan 1/2 cup jumbo popcorn kernels 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese 1 tablespoon salt (optional: 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, store-bought or homemade)"

snacks,Slow Cooker Chex Mix,"Add cereal, pretzels, cheerios and peanuts to the bowl of a slow cooker. In a separate bowl, whisk together butter and seasoned salt until the salt is dissolved.  Stir in the Worcestershire sauce until combined. Drizzle the sauce evenly over the top of the cereal mixture.  Toss for about 1 minute, or until the mixture is evenly combined. Cover and slow cook on low for 3 hours,  stirring at the 1 hour, 2 hour and 2.5 hour marks so that the mixture does not burn.  Then spread the mixture out onto a few baking sheets or parchment paper in an even layer until it cools to room temperature.  Serve, or store in a sealed container for up to 3 weeks. *If your slow cooker does not have a tiny hole in it to let air escape, it may collect too much condensation which could make the Chex Mix get too soggy.  If that is the case, another great method is to place a towel (or a few layers of paper towels) just under the lid of the slow cooker, to collect the condensation.*","9 cups Chex cereal (I used equal parts corn, rice, and wheat Chex) 2 cups pretzels 1 cup Cheerios 1 cup peanuts 1/3 cup (6 Tablespoons) butter, melted and hot 1 Tablespoon seasoned salt 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce 1 teaspoon garlic powder (optional)"
